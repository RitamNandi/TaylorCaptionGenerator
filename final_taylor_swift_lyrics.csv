lyric
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
"And this is our place, we make the rules"
"And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear"
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
"Forever and ever, ah"
"Take me out, and take me home"
"You're my, my, my, my lover"
We could let our friends crash in the living room
"This is our place, we make the call"
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
"I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all"
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
"Forever and ever, ah"
"Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)"
"You're my, my, my, my lover"
"Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?"
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
"And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover"
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
"Forever and ever, ah"
"Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)"
"You're my, my, my, my"
"Oh, you're my, my, my, my"
"Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
"Of the fool, no, I don't like you"
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
"Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)"
"But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time"
"Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time"
"I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined"
"I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!"
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
"The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama"
"But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma"
"And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure"
"Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours"
"But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time"
"Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time"
"I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined"
"I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!"
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
"Ooh, look what you made me do"
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
"(Ooh, look what you made me do"
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
"Ooh, look what you made me do"

Intro Taylor Swift
I promise that you'll never find another like me
 1 Taylor Swift
"I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh"
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
Pre-Chorus Taylor Swift
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors

 2 Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
"But I will never bore you, baby"
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
"Pre-Chorus Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie"
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
"Livin' in winter, I am your summer"

I promise that you'll never find another like me
"Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"""
"But you know there is a ""me"""
"And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me"""
I promise that you'll never find another like

You're the only one of you
"Baby, that's the fun of you"
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
"And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM"
"Say it in the street, that's a knock-out"
"But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out"
"And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?"""
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
"So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
"You need to calm down, you're being too loud"
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)"
"You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?"
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
"So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
"You need to calm down, you're being too loud"
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)"
"You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?"
You need to calm down
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)"
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
"But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom"
"Holdin' him for ransom, some"
"Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though"
"Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so"
"I see nothing better, I keep him forever"
Like a vendetta-ta
"I, I, I see how this is gon' go"
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams"
"You should see the things we do, baby"
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams"
"I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time"
Are you ready for it?
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
"But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and"
"We'll move to an island, and"
"And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor"
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
"I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now"
"Never be the same now, now"
"I, I, I see how this is gon' go"
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams"
"You should see the things we do, baby"
In the middle of the night in my dreams
"I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time"
Are you ready for it?
"Oh, are you ready for it?"
"Baby, let the games begin"
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
"Baby, let the games begin"
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
"I, I, I see how this is gon' go"
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
"In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)"
"You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)"
"In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)"
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night
"Baby, let the games begin"
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
"Baby, let the games begin"
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
"Nice to meet you, where you been?"
I could show you incredible things
"Magic, madness, heaven, sin"
"Saw you there, and I thought"
"Oh my God, look at that face	5	201-10-27
6	1989 (Deluxe)	Blank Space 	You look like my next mistake	6	201-10-27
6	1989 (Deluxe)	Blank Space 	Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy
"New money, suit and tie"
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
"So hey, let's be friends"
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
"You can tell me when it's over, mm"
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
"It'll leave you breathless, hmm"
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
"But I've got a blank space, baby"
And I'll write your name
"Cherry lips, crystal skies"
I could show you incredible things
"Stolen kisses, pretty lies"
"You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen"
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
"Wait, the worst is yet to come"
"Oh, no"
"Screaming, crying, perfect storms"
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
"'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream"
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
"You can tell me when it's over, mm"
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
"It'll leave you breathless, hmm"
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
"But I've got a blank space, baby"
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
"Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya"
Boys only want love if it's torture
"Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya"
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
"You can tell me when it's over, mm"

"But I've got a blank space, baby"
And I'll write your name
"Vintage tee, brand new phone"
High heels on cobblestones
"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
"Sequin smile, black lipstick"
Sensual politics
"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
"Drunk under a streetlight, I"
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
"Baby, kiss it better, I"
Refrain
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
"Chase two girls, lose the one"
"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
"Giving me your weekends, I"
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
"Once in twenty lifetimes, I"
Refrain
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
"Marked me like a bloodstain, I"
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
"Peter losing Wendy, I"
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
"Running like water, I"
"And when you are young, they assume you know nothing"
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
Refrain
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit"
"Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no"""
"I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though"
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
"I guess you never know, never know"
"And if you wanted me, you really should've showed"
"And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow"
And it's alright now
"But we were something, don't you think so?"
"Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool"
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
"In my defense, I have none"
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
"We never painted by the numbers, baby"
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
"I guess you never know, never know"
And it's another day waking up alone
"But we were something, don't you think so?"
"Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool"
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
"In my defense, I have none"
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
"I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you"
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?
"We were something, don't you think so?"
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
"In my defense, I have none"
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

"Ah, ah"
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
"They took the crown, but it's alright"
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
"So call it what you want, yeah"
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
"So call it what you want, yeah"
Call it what you want to
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
"Bridges burn, I never learn"
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
"I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers"
Trust him like a brother
"Yeah, you know I did one thing right"
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
"So call it what you want, yeah"
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
"So call it what you want, yeah"
Call it what you want to
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
"Which is more than they can say, I"
I recall late November
"Holding my breath, slowly, I said"
"You don't need to save me	5	2017-11-0
10	reputation	Call It What You Want 	But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
"So call it what you want, yeah"
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
"(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)"
"So call it what you want, yeah"
Call it what you want to

Intro
This ain't for the best
"My reputation's never been worse, so"
You must like me for me…
We can't make
"Any promises now, can we, babe?"
But you can make me a drink
"Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?"
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
"Come here, you can meet me in the back"
"Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you"
"Oh damn, never seen that color blue"
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
"My reputation's never been worse, so"
You must like me for me…
"Yeah, I want you"
We can't make
"Any promises now, can we, babe?"
But you can make me a drink
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?
"Third floor on the West Side, me and you"
"Handsome, you're a mansion with a view"
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
"Long night, with your hands up in my hair"
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
"Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share"
'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
"I pretend you're mine, all the damn time"

Intro
"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
"You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)"
"Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price"
"You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)"
"Killing me slow, out the window"
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
"Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes"
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
"And it's new, the shape of your body"
"It's blue, the feeling I've got"
"And it's ooh, whoa oh"
It's a cruel summer
"It's cool, that's what I tell 'em"
No rules in breakable heaven
"But ooh, whoa oh"
It's a cruel summer
With you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
"I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)"
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
"We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)"
Pre-Chorus 2
"So cut the headlights, summer's a knife"
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
"Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes"

"It's cool, that's what I tell 'em"
No rules in breakable heaven
"But ooh, whoa oh"
It's a cruel summer
With you
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
"Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true"
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
"And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth"
"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"""
"He looks up, grinning like a devil"
"It's new, the shape of your body"
"It's blue, the feeling I've got"
"And it's ooh, whoa oh"

Midnight
"You come and pick me up, no headlights"
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
"Fade into view, oh"
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
"And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I"
"Know exactly where it leads, but I"
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
"And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
"You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt"
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
"And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
"The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)"
"I say, ""I heard, oh"
"That you've been out and about with some other girl"""
Some other girl
"He says, ""What you heard is true, but I"
"Can't stop thinking 'bout you,"" and I"
"I said, ""I've been there too a few times"""

Take me home
Just take me home
"Yeah, just take me home"

"Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye"
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

"Betty, I won't make assumptions"
"About why you switched your homeroom, but"
I think it's 'cause of me
"Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard"
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
"Most times, but this time it was true"
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
"In the garden, would you trust me"
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything"
But I know I miss you
"Betty, I know where it all went wrong"
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
"I hate the crowds, you know that"
"Plus, I saw you dance with him"
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
"Most times, but this time it was true"
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
"In the garden, would you trust me"
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything"
But I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
"She said ""James, get in, let's drive"""
Those days turned into nights
"Slept next to her, but"
I dreamt of you all summer long
"Betty, I'm here on your doorstep"
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
"Betty, right now is the last time"
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
"Yeah, I showed up at your party"
"Yeah, I showed up at your party"
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
"If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?"
Will it patch your broken wings?
"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything"
But I know I miss you
Outro
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you
Intro
Gorgeous
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
"And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us"
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
"You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much"
(I hate you so much)
Pre-Chorus 1
"Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine"
You've ruined my life by not being mine
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous
You should take it as a compliment
"That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)"
And you should think about the consequence
"Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)"
"If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her"
But if you're single that's honestly worse
"'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)"
Pre-Chorus 2
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
"'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)"
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
"Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone"
"Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)"
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)

"Salt air, and the rust on your door"
I never needed anything more
"Whispers of ""Are you sure?"""
Never have I ever before
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
"For me, it was enough"
To live for the hope of it all
Canceled plans just in case you'd call
"And say, ""Meet me behind the mall"""
"So much for summer love and saying ""us"""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
"You weren't mine to lose, no"
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Outro
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
"Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car"""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
"Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all"
Meet me behind the mall
"(Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car"")"

"(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)"
"I would be complex, I would be cool"
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I’d be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man"
I'd be the man
I'd be the man
"They'd say I hustled, put in the work"
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
"What I was wearing, if I was rude"
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
"And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play"
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man"
I’d be the man
I'd be the man
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
"I'd be a bitch, not a baller"
They'd paint me out to be bad
"So, it's okay that I'm mad"
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)

"'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man"

I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
"Shakin', pacin', I just need you"
"For you, I would cross the line"
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
"They say, ""She's gone too far this time"""

And I'm just gonna call you mine

Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
"I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy"
Pre-Chorus 2
"And baby, for you, I would fall from grace"
Just to touch your face
"If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay"

So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
"'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three"

Now all he thinks about is me
Pre-Chorus 1
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
"If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing"
"I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming"
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?

"And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?"
"Cursing my name, wishing I stayed"
Look at how my tears ricochet
"We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean"
"Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring"
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
"'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave"
"And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?"
"Cursing my name, wishing I stayed"
Look at how my tears ricochet
And I can go anywhere I want
"Anywhere I want, just not home"
"And you can aim for my heart, go for blood"
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
"You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same"
"Cursing my name, wishing I stayed"
You turned into your worst fears
"And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain"
Crossing out the good years
"And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed"
Look at how my tears ricochet
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
"Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo"
"All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation"
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
"Ha, ah, ah"
"All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting"
My hands are shaking from all this
"Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah"
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
"Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah"
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
"Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah"
"Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try"
"And if I get burned, at least we were electrified"
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about—
"All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation"
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
"Ha, ah, ah"
"All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting"

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
"Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me"
Flashback to my mistakes
"My rebounds, my earthquakes"
"Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me"
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
"My one and only, my lifeline"
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
"My hands shake, I can't explain this"
"Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah"
Say my name and everything just stops...

"Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny"
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
"And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"""
"The wedding was charming, if a little gauche"
There's only so far new money goes
"They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House"""
"Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud"
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
"Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been"
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
"Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been"
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
They say she was seen on occasion
"Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea"
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
"Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits"
And then it was bought by me
"Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been"
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

"I say I don't want that, but what if I do?"

"I jump from the train, I ride off alone"
"I never grew up, it's getting so old"
Help me hold on to you

"Who could ever leave me, darling"
But who could stay?
"Dark side, I search for your dark side"
"But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?"
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
"I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost"
"The room is on fire, invisible smoke"
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
"I've been the archer, I've been the prey"
"Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling"
But who could stay?
"(I see right through me, I see right through me)"
'Cause they see right through me

Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
"All the king's horses, all the king's men"
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
"Time, curious time"
"Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs"
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
"Time, mystical time"
"Cutting me open, then healing me fine"
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A string that pulled me
"Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar"
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
"Time, wondrous time"
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
"Baby, with me"
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
"And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends"
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
"And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name"
"And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away"
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
"Windows flung right open, autumn air"
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
"Back when we were card sharks, playing games"
I thought you were leading me on
"I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street"
Before you even knew I was gone
"But then you called, showed your hand"
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
"Sat on the roof, you and I"
"I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends"

Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
"That became my religion, listen"

I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
Make sure nobody sees you leave
"Hood over your head, keep your eyes down"
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
"A dwindling, mercurial high"
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times
And you wanna scream
"Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby"""
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
"Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby"""
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
Outro
And you know damn well
"For you, I would ruin myself"
A million little times
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
"But I, I was high in the sky"
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
Sweet tea in the summer
"Cross your heart, won't tell no other"
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
"I, I"
Sweet tea in the summer
"Cross my heart, won’t tell no other"
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long
"I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own"
"I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone"
We met a few weeks ago
"Now you try on callin' me ""Baby"" like tryin' on clothes"
"Salute to me, I'm your American queen"
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do
"And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for"
"King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa"
"And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go"
"King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa"
"And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting"
"Ooh whoa, ooh whoa"
"And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting"
"Body and soul, ooh whoa"
And all at once
"Late in the night, the city's asleep"
"Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury
"Salute to me, I'm your American queen"
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
"(Inside my room, oh)"
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

"And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go"
"King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa"
"And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)"
"Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa"
"And all at once, you are the one"
"I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)"
"Body and soul, ooh whoa"
And all at once
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
"Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff"
"Baby, all at once, this is enough"
"And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for"
"King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa"
"And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for"
"King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa"
"And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go"
"King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa"
"And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting"
"Ooh whoa, ooh whoa"
And all at once
"'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting"
"Body and soul, ooh whoa"
And all at once
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
"I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye"
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
"And now I see daylight, I only see daylight"
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
"Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke"
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
"It's brighter now, now"
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
"And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)"
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
"All of you, all of me (Intertwined)"
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
"Like daylight, like daylight"
"Like daylight, daylight"
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
"And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)"
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)"
(And I can still see it all)
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
"(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)"
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
(I once believed love would be burning red)
Outro
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
"Just let it go, let it go"
Spoken Outro
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
"Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of"
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
"I, I just think that"
You are what you love
How many days did I spend thinking
"'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?"
Lived in the shade you were throwing
"'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone"
And I couldn't get away from ya
"In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah"
"Your name on my lips, tongue-tied"
"Free rent, living in my mind"
But then something happened one magical night
I forgot that you existed
"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't"
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference"
I forgot that you
Got out some popcorn
"As soon as my rep started going down, down, down"
Laughed on the school yard
"As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground"
And I would've stuck around for ya
"Would've fought the whole town, so yeah"
"Would've been right there, front row"
Even if nobody came to your show
"But you showed who you are, then one magical night"
I forgot that you existed
"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't"
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference"
I forgot that you
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur
I forgot that you existed
"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't"
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
"I did, I did, I did"
"It isn't hate, it's just indifference"
"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference"
"So, yeah"
Intro
"He said, ""Let's get out of this town"
"Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"""
"I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now"""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
Pre-Chorus 1
He's so tall and handsome as hell
"He's so bad, but he does it so well"
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
"Staring at the sunset, babe"
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa"
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa"
"I said, ""No one has to know what we do"""
"His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room"
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now
Pre-Chorus 2
He's so tall and handsome as hell
"He's so bad, but he does it so well"
And when we've had our very last kiss
"My last request, it is"
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
"Staring at the sunset, babe"
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa (Ah-aah, haa)"
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa"
"You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night"
Burnin' it down
"Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories"
Follow you around
"You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night"
Burning (Burning) it (It) down (Down)
"Someday when you leave me, I'll bet these memories"
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around)
(Follow you around)
Breakdown
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
"Staring at the sunset, babe"
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
"Staring at the sunset, babe"
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
"Even if it's just in your (Pretend, just pretend)"
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha (Ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-hafhaa)"
"In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa"
Even if it's just in your
"Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa"
"In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa"
I've been having a hard time adjusting
"I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting"
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
"I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere"
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least I'm trying
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
Outro
At least I'm trying
Intro
"My, my, my, my"
"My, my, my, my"
"My, my, my, my"
"My, my, my, my"
"My, my, my, my"
"My, my, my, my"
"My, my, my, my"
"My, my, my, my"
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
"I get drunk, but it's not enough"
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
"I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home"
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
"They say, ""I don't know"""
And what once was ours is no one's now
"I see you everywhere, the only thing we share"
Is this small town
"You said it was a great love, one for the ages"
"But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?"
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
"I get drunk, but it's not enough"
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
"My heart, my hips, my body, my love"
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
"Our songs, our films, united we stand"
"Our country, guess it was a lawless land"
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
"My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust"
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
"Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough"
"But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts"
"I get drunk, but it's not enough"
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
"No, it's not"
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
"My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)"
"But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no"
Outro
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
"They say, ""I don't know"""
We were both young when I first saw you
"I close my eyes, and the flashback starts"
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
See you make your way through the crowd
"And say, ""hello"""
Little did I know
Pre-Chorus 1
"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
"And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet"""
And I was crying on the staircase
"Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said"
1
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
"It's a love story, baby, just say ""yes"""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
"We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew"
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Pre-Chorus 2
"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter"
"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
But you were everything to me
"I was begging you please don't go, and I said"
2
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
"Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel"
"This love is difficult, but it's real"
"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess"
"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
"Oh, oh"
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
"And I said ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone"
I keep waiting for you but you never come
"Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"""
"He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said"
Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress"
"It's a love story, baby, just say 'yes'"""
Outro
"Oh, oh"
"Oh, oh"
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
"You and me from the night before, but"
1
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
"I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe"
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
2
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
"Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you"
"Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you"
"Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you"
And I will hold on to you
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
"They strike to kill, and you know I will"
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
"Or does she mouth, ""Fuck you forever""?"
"Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy"
What about that?
"And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry"
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
"They say ""move on,"" but you know I won't"
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together
"Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy"
What about that?
"And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry"
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman
"I'm taking my time, taking my time"
'Cause you took everything from me
"Watching you climb, watching you climb"
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
"She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but"
Outro
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that
See you in the dark
"All eyes on you, my magician"
All eyes on us
"You make everyone disappear, and"
Cut me into pieces
"Gold cage, hostage to my feelings"
Back against the wall
"Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone"
'Cause we break down a little
"But when you get me alone, it's so simple"
"'Cause baby, I know what you know"
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
"You know I'm not a bad girl, but I"
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
Met you in a bar
"All eyes on me, your illusionist"
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
"I'm so chill, but you make me jealous"
But I got your heart
"Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone"
'Cause we break down a little
"But when I get you alone, it's so simple"
"'Cause baby, I know what you know"
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
"You know I'm not a bad girl, but I"
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
Refrain
"Come here, dressed in black now"
"So, so, so it goes"
Scratches down your back now
"So, so, so it goes"
You did a number on me
"But, honestly, baby, who's counting?"
I did a number on you
"But, honestly, baby, who's counting?"
You did a number on me
"But, honestly, baby, who's counting?"
Who's counting?
"(1, 2, )"
And all the pieces fall right into place (Pieces fall)
"Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)"
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep (Oh)
And I'm yours to lose (Baby)
"You know I'm not a bad girl, but I"
I do bad things with you
So it goes…
Refrain
"Come here, dressed in black now"
"So, so, so it goes"
Scratches down your back now
"So, so, so it goes"

Scratches down your back now
"So, so, so it goes"
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
"Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, , )"
"I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings"
"Uh huh, that's right"
"Darling, you're the one I want, and"
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
"Uh huh, that's right"
"Darling, you're the one I want"
"In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams"
"Oh, you're the one I want"
"In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool"
"When you jumped in first, I went in too"
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
"Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws"
"We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so"
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
"Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, , )"
Ah
"I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings"
"Uh huh, that's right"

"Uh huh, that's right"
"Darling, you're the one I want"
"In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams"
"Oh, you're the one I want"
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
"Wrap your arms around me, baby boy"
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays

It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling"
Because you break them
I had to take them away
"This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)"
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things
It was so nice being friends again
"There I was, giving you a second chance"
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)"
Because you break them
I had to take them away
"This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey"
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have
Here's a toast to my real friends
"They don't care about the he-said, she-said"
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
"Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face"
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)"
Because you break them
I had to take them away
"This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)"
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling"
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
"Nice things, honey"
"(He didn't care about that he-said, she-said)"
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
"And when I break, it's in a million pieces"
"Hush, when no one is around, my dear"
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
Shining just for you
"Hush, I know they said the end is near"
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
Shining just for you
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
"Hush, when no one is around, my dear"
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
Shining just for you
"Hush, I know they said the end is near"
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
"Spinning in my highest heels, love"
Shining just for you
"And they called off the circus, burned the disco down"
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
"And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why"
"I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try"
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me
Outro
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
"I still do it for you, babe"
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
"When you're led by blind faith, blind faith"
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
I know heaven's a thing
"I go there when you touch me, honey"
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
"You still do it for me, babe"
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
"When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith"
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
"We'd still worship this love, ah"
Outro
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love
I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
"I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans"
"It's like I'm 17, nobody understands"
No one understands
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
"I got that, ah, I mean"
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
"I want you, bless my soul"
"And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows"
I think he knows
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
"I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans"
"He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand"
"Boy, I understand"
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
"I got that, ah, I mean (I mean)"
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
"I want you, bless my soul"
"And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows"
I think he knows
"I want you, bless my"
"I want you, bless my"
"I want you, bless my"
"I want you, bless my soul"
"Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh"
"We could follow the sparks, I'll drive"
"Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh"
"We could follow the sparks, I'll drive"
So where we gonna go?
I whisper in the dark
Where we gonna go?
I think he knows
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
"I got that, ah, I mean (I mean)"
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
"I want you, bless my soul"
"And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows"
I think he knows
"I want you, bless my"
"I want you, bless my"
"I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)"
"I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)"
"I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)"
"I want you, bless my"
"I want you, bless my soul"
"And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows"
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
"Suddenly this summer, it's clear"
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
"And it's just around the corner, darlin'"
'Cause it lives in me
"No, I could never give you peace"
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
"If your cascade, ocean wave blues come"
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
"The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me"
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
"I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor"
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
"Give you my wild, give you a child"
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
"Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother"
Is it enough?
"But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west"
"I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best"
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
"If your cascade, ocean wave blues come"
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
"The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me"
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
"In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared"
That was the first time we were there
"Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you"
"Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too"
And I say to you...

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
"You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal"
I just pretend it isn't real

Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
"I pinned your hands behind your back, oh"
"Thought I had reason to attack, but no"
Pre-Chorus 1
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
"Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us"
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
"It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say"
"Hey, it's all me, in my head"
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
"I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)"
"I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)"
"I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go"
Meet me in the afterglow
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
"Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh"
Pre-Chorus 2
"I lived like an island, punished you with silence"
"Went off like sirens, just crying"
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
"It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say"
"Hey, it's all me, in my head"
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
"I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)"
"I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)"
"I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go"
Meet me in the afterglow
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
"Hey, it's all me, in my head"
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
"I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)"
"I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)"
"I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go"
Meet me in the afterglow
"I, I loved you in secret"
"First sight, yeah, we love without reason"
"Oh, twenty-five years old"
"Oh, how were you to know? And"
"My, my love had been frozen"
"Deep blue, but you painted me golden"
"Oh, and you held me close"
"Oh, how was I to know? I–"
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
"And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis"
"People started talking, putting us through our paces"
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied"
"Yeah, we were dancing"
"Like it was the first time, first time"
"Yeah, we were dancing"
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied"
"Yeah, we were dancing"
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
"I, I loved you in spite of"
Deep fears that the world would divide us
"So, baby, can we dance?"
"Oh, through an avalanche? And"
"Say, say that we got it"
"I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted"
"Oh, 'cause it's gravity"
"Oh, keeping you with me, I–"
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied"
"Yeah, we were dancing"
"Like it was the first time, first time"
"Yeah, we were dancing"
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied"
"Yeah, we were dancing"
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied"
"Oh, yeah, we were dancing"
"Like it was the first time, first time (first time, first time)"
"Yeah, we were dancing (oh)"
"Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied"
(Dancing with our hands tied)
"Yeah, we were dancing (ooh)"
And I had a bad feeling (had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground
"Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason"""
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire
"Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason"""
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
"(Ah, ah, ah)"
"Darling, this was just as hard"
As when they pulled me apart
Outro
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
"Keep your helmet, keep your life, son"
"Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle"
Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about
"With you I serve, with you I fall down, down"
"Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out"
Something med school did not cover
"Someone's daughter, someone's mother"
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
"With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)"
"Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out"
"With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)"
"Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)"
Outro
Only twenty minutes to sleep

Intro
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
"But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I"
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
"In your drawer, even now"
"Oh, your sweet disposition"
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
Pre-Chorus 1
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all"
"Oh, oh, oh"
1
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
"Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well"
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
"You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me"
Pre-Chorus 2
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
2
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
"Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah"
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
"Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well"
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
"'Cause I remember it all, all, all"
Too well
"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it"
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
"'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah"
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
Outro
"Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all"
"Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all"
"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
"That's what people say, mmm, mmm"
"That's what people say, mmm, mmm"
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
"At least that's what people say, mmm, mmm"
"That's what people say, mmm, mmm"
Pre-Chorus 1
But I keep cruisin'
"Can't stop, won't stop movin'"
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright
"'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play"
"And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate"
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
"I shake it off, I shake it off"
"Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break"
"And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake"
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
"I shake it off, I shake it off"
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
"And that's what they don’t see, mmm, mmm"
"That's what they don’t see, mmm, mmm"
I'm dancing on my own (Dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
"And that's what they don't know, mmm, mmm"
"That’s what they don’t know, mmm, mmm"
Pre-Chorus 2
But I keep cruisin'
"Can't stop, won't stop groovin'"
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright
"'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play"
"And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate"
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"

Interlude
"Hey, hey, hey"
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
"And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world"
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
"She's like, “Oh my God,” but I'm just gonna shake"
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
"Won't you come on over, baby?"
"We can shake, shake, shake"
"Yeah, oh, oh, oh"
"'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play"
"And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate"
(Haters gonna hate)
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
"I shake it off, I shake it off"
"Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (Mmhm)"
"And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake"

When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
"It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)"
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Pre-Chorus 1
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down
"When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe"
And by morning
"Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean"
"(Oh, oh, oh, oh)"
"There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)"
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
"So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)"
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
Pre-Chorus 2
"The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud"
But no one heard a thing
Rain came pouring down

Sleeping in tents
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
"Light pink sky, up on the roof"
"Sun sinks down, no curfew"
"20 questions, we tell the truth"

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
"When we decided, we decided"
To move the furniture so we could dance
"Baby, like we stood a chance"
"Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying"
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
(Out of the woods)
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
"When you started crying, baby, I did too"
"But when the sun came up, I was looking at you"
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
"I walked out and said, ""I'm setting you free"""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
"When the sun came up, you were looking at me"
"You were looking at me, ooh"
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?

"When she fell, she fell apart."
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
"When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away"
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends
"When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink"
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep
"Whatever you say, it is not right."
"Whatever you do, it is not enough."
Your kindness is fake.
Your pain is manipulative.
"When she lay there on the ground,"
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
"and a love that was really something,"
Not just the idea of something.
"When she finally rose, she rose slowly"
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
"Wary of phone calls and promises,"
"Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes"
"When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness"
"Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck"
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
"was a love that was really something,"
not just the idea of something.
"When she turned to go home,"
She heard the echoes of new words
"May your heart remain breakable	0	2017-11-10
61	reputation	Why She Disappeared Poem 	But never by the same hand twice"
And even louder
"without your past,		2017-11-10
61	reputation	Why She Disappeared Poem 	you could never have arrived-		2017-11-10
61	reputation	Why She Disappeared Poem 	so wondrously and brutally,	5	2017-11-10
61	reputation	Why She Disappeared Poem 	By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance	6	2017-11-10
61	reputation	Why She Disappeared Poem 	...here."
"And in the death of her reputation,"
She felt truly alive.
"You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset"
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
"I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night"
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
"But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts"
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
"Been here all along, so why can't you see?"
"You belong with me, you belong with me"
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
"Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself"
"Hey, isn't this easy?"
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
"You say you're fine, I know you better than that"
"Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?"
"She wears high heels, I wear sneakers"
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
"Been here all along, so why can't you see?"
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
"All this time how could you not know, baby?"
"You belong with me, you belong with me"
"Oh, I remember you driving to my house"
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
"Been here all along, so why can't you see?"
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
"All this time how could you not know, baby?"
"You belong with me, you belong with me"
Outro
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me
Intro
"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago"
"I was in your sights, you got me alone"
"You found me, you found me, you found me"
"I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that"
"And when I fell hard, you took a step back"
"Without me, without me, without me"
"And he's long gone, when he's next to me"
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
"So, shame on me now"
Flew me to places I'd never been
"'Til you put me down, oh"
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
"So, shame on me now"
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
"Oh, oh-oh"
"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
"Oh, oh-oh"
"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
"No apologies, he'll never see you cry"
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
"You're drowning, you're drowning"
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
"And now I see, now I see"
Now I see
He was long gone when he met me
"And I realize the joke is on me, hey!"
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
"So, shame on me now"
Flew me to places I'd never been
"'Til you put me down, oh"
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
"So, shame on me now"
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
"Oh, oh-oh (yeah)"
"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
"Oh, oh-oh"
"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
"Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!"
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
"So, shame on me now"
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
"'Til you put me down, oh"
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Knew it right there)
"So, shame on me now (knew it right there)"
Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
"Oh, oh-oh"
"Trouble, trouble, trouble (oh)"

"We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything"
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
"Trust me, mine is better"
"We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin"
"We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing"
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
"Honey, life is just a classroom"
"(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)"
"'Cause baby, I could build a castle"
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
"Baby, we're the new romantics"
"Come on, come along with me"
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
"Baby, we're the new romantics"
The best people in life are free
"We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding"
"We hang back, it's all in the timing"
It's poker
You can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace (ahh)
"We need love, but all we want is danger"
"We team up, then switch sides like a record changer"
The rumors are terrible and cruel
"But honey, most of them are true"
"(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)"
"'Cause baby, I could build a castle"
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
"Baby, we're the new romantics"
"Come on, come along with me"
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing (yeah) to get knocked off our feet

Please take my hand and
"Please take me dancing, and"
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
"(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)"
Breakdown
"Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle"
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
"And every day is like a battle, oh-oh"
But every night with us is like a dream

I remember when we broke up the first time
"Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like"
We hadn't seen each other in a month
"When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)"
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
"I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you"""
Pre-Chorus 1
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
"We called it off again last night, but"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
"This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you"
"We are never, ever, ever getting back together"
"We are never, ever, ever getting back together"
"You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me"
"But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"
"Like, ever"
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
"And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right"
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Pre-Chorus 2
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
"You called me up again tonight, but"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
"This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you"
"We are never, ever, ever getting back together"

Outro

Getting back together

Getting back together

(Talk to me)
"But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
"And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh"
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
"To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh"
Yeah
"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time"
"It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah"
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
"It's time, oh-oh"
"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
"22, 22"
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
"Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh"
"(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)"
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping
Yeah
"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way"
"It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah"
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
"It's time, oh-oh"
(Hey!)
"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
Everything will be alright (Ooh) if you keep me next to you
"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
"We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)"
22 (I don't know about you)
"22, 22"
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
"Ooh, ooh, yeah"
(Hey!)
"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
Everything will be alright if (Ooh) you keep me next to you
"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
"22 (Whoa, oh)"
22 (Dancing like)
"22 (Yeah, yeah), 22, (Yeah, yeah, yeah)"
Outro
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
"Flashing lights, and we"
"Took a wrong turn, and we"
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control
Pre-Chorus 1
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
"Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?"
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
"And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)"
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
"And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
In Wonderland
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
In Wonderland
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
In Wonderland
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
In Wonderland
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
"All alone, or so it seemed"
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
"And talking turned to screams, oh"
Pre-Chorus 2
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
"Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?"
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
"And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)"
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
"And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
In Wonderland
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
In Wonderland
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
In Wonderland
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
"Whoa, in Wonderland"
"I reached for you, but you were gone"
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
"And in the end, in Wonderland"
We both went mad
Oh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
"Last forever (ey, ey)"
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better
"Never better (ey, ey)"
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
And we pretended it could last forever (in Wonderland)
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
"(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)"
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland
"One look, dark room"
Meant just for you
"Time moved too fast, you play it back"
"Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke"
"No proof, not much, but you saw enough"
"Small talk, he drives"
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
"He says, ""Look up"""
And your shoulders brush
"No proof, one touch, but you felt enough"
"You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you"
"You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you"
"You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)"
"You are in love, true love"
You are in love
"Morning, his place"
"Burnt toast, Sunday"
"You keep his shirt, he keeps his word"
"And for once, you let go"
Of your fears and your ghosts
"One step, not much, but it said enough"
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
"One night, he wakes"
Strange look on his face
"Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend"""
"And you knew what it was, he is in love"
"You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you"
"You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you"
"You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)"
"You are in love, true love"
And so it goes
"You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round"
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
Breakdown
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
"You are in love, true love"
You are in love
"You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you"
"You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you"
"You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)"
"You are in love, true love"
You are in love
"You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you"
"You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you"
"You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)"
"You are in love, true love"
You are in love

 1 Taylor Swift
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
"In the back of my mind, making me feel like"
Pre-Chorus Taylor Swift &  Ed Sheeran

So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed

All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
"And I could go on and on, on and on"
And I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
"And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone"
Pre-Chorus 1
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

"This love is good, this love is bad"
"This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh"
"These hands had to let it go free, and"
"This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh"
"Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh"
"Tossing, turning"
Struggled through the night with someone new
"And I could go on and on, on and on"

"Flickered in my mind, only you"
"But you were still gone, gone, gone"
Pre-Chorus 2

You showed up just in time

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
"Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?"
(Stay!) Hey
"Now, you say you want it back"
Now that it's just too late
"Well, could've been easy"
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was stay
"Here you are now, calling me up"
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
"Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?"
(Stay!) Hey
"Now, you say you want it back"
Now that it's just too late
"Well, could've been easy"
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay! stay! stay! stay! stay!)
Let me remind you
"This was what you wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)"
You ended it
"You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)"
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
"Oh, all you had to do was"
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
"Then, why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?"
(Stay!) Hey
"Now, you say you want it back"
Now that it's just too late
"Well, could've been easy"
All you had to do was
(Stay!) Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
"Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?"
(Stay!) Hey
"Now, you say you want it back"
Now that it's just too late
(All you had to do was stay)
"Well, could've been easy"
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!) (Oh)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!) (Ooh)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
"And all we know, is touch and go"
We are alone with our changing minds
"We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time"
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
"Now all we know, is don’t let go"
"We are alone, just you and me"
Up in your room and our slates are clean
"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes"
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never (never) be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
Breakdown
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never (never) be the same
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never
(So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same
(We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild)
Outro
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

"I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I"
"I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I (I, I, I, I)"
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
"It's a bad sign, bad sign"
Something happens when everybody finds out
"See the vultures circling, dark clouds"
"Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out"
It could burn out
Pre-Chorus 1
"'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns"
"They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run"
"Baby, I know places we won't be found"
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
"'Cause I, I know places we can hide"
"I know places, I know places"
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
"Let them say what they want, we won't hear it"
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time
Pre-Chorus 2
"Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love"
"They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run"
"Baby, I know places we won't be found"

"'Cause I, I know places we can hide"
I know places
"They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run"

I know places

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
"Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight"
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone"
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can
"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone"
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
"Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong"
Don't you think nineteen's too young
"To be played by your dark, twisted games"
When I loved you so?
I shoulda known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
"Over your sad empty town, yeah"
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone"
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known
Outro
You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda known
Here's something I've learned about people.
"We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip."
"This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you."
"The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'."
"When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?"
"Let me say it again, louder for those in the back..."
"We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us."
There will be no further explanation.
There will be just reputation.
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
"Faster than the wind, passionate as sin"
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
"Like the colors in autumn, so bright"
Just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
"Oh, red"
Burning red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go"
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red
"Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known"
"Missing him was dark grey, all alone"
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
"Yeah, yeah, red"
We're burning red
Breakdown
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
"Comes back to me, burning red"
"Yeah, yeah"
Outro
His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
"If you're anything like me,"
"You bite your nails,"
And laugh when you're nervous.
"You promise people the world,"
because that's what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
"But darling, you need to stop,"
"If you're anything like me,"
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
"You cross your fingers, hold your breath,"
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
"Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado..."
"If life gets too good now,"
"Darling, it scares you."
"If you're anything like me,"
"You never wanted to lock your door,"
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
"But Darling, now you have to."
"If you're anything like me,"
There's a justice system in your head
"For names you'll never speak again,"
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
"They become the bars that confine you,"
In your own little golden prison cell...
"But Darling, there is where you meet yourself."
If you're anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
"But Darling, you keep trying."
"If you're anything like me,"
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
"Darling, later on you will thank your stars"
for that frightful day.
"If you're anything like me,"
I'm sorry.
"But Darling, it's going to be okay."
"Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow"
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore"
"The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me"
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
"Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer"
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore"
"The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me"
"Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"Like any great love, it keeps you guessing"
"Like any real love, it's ever-changing"
"Like any true love, it drives you crazy"
"But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything"
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you"
"Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
"It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat"
"The lights are so bright, but they never blind me"
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
"So bright, they never blind me"
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's 2AM in your car
"Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start"
"You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead"
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
1
I wish you would come back
"Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I"
Wish you knew that
"I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I"
"Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good"
I wish you would
It's 2AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
"Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I"
Wish you knew that

I wish you would
I wish we could go back
"And remember what we were fighting for, and I"
Wish you knew that
"I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I"
"Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good"
I wish you would
"I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I"
"I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I"
"I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I"
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
"This mad, mad love makes you come running"
To stand back where you stood
"I wish you would, I wish you would"
"(I wish you would, I wish you would)"
"I wish you would, I wish you would"
"(I wish you would, I wish you would)"
"(I wish I, wish I)"
"2AM, here we are"
"See your face, hear my voice in the dark"
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

There I was again tonight
"Forcing laughter, faking smiles"
"Same old tired, lonely place"
"Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy"
Vanished when I saw your face
"All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you"
"Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?"""
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
"All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you"
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
"2AM, who do you love?"
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
"I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey"""
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
2
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Breakdown
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

"Oh, oh, oh"
"Oh, oh, oh"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh"
Stand there like a ghost
"Shaking from the rain, rain"
"She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane?"""
Say it's been a long six months
"And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want"
Pre-Chorus 1
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
"And then, you say"
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
"Broke your heart, I'll put it back together"
I would wait forever and ever

And that's how it works
"That's how you get the girl, girl"
"Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah"
"With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks"
"Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh"
When you left her all alone

Outro
That's how it works
That's how you got the girl
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 158
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away
I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
"Your name, forever the name on my lips"
I do remember the swing of your step
"The life of the party, you're showing off again"
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did
"Because I love your handshake, meeting my father"
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
"Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh"
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
"Your name, forever the name on my lips"
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Outro
Just like our last
Took a deep breath in the mirror
"He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do"
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
"He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do"
"Walked in, expecting you'd be late"
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
"And you don't know how nice that is, but I do"
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
"But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again"
You said you never met one girl who
"Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do"
We tell stories and you don't know why
"I'm coming off a little shy, but I do"
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
"But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again"
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies that your family watches
"Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that"
"And for the first time, what's past is past"
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
"But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again"
Outro
"But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again"
"You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables"
Left a small town and never looked back
"I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling"
"Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts"
Pre-Chorus 1
"I say, ""Can you believe it?"""
As we're lying on the couch
"The moment, I could see it"
"Yes, yes, I can see it now"
"Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?"
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
"Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together"
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
Pre-Chorus 2
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
"Yes, yes"
This is what I thought about
"Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?"
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
"And I remember that fight, 20 AM"
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
"I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street"
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
"Then, you took me by surprise"
"You said, ""I'll never leave you alone."""
2
"You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water"
"And every time I look at you, it's like the first time"
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
"She is the best thing that's ever been mine"""
"Hold on, make it last"
"Hold on, never turn back"
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Outro
"Yeah, yeah"
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
"Yeah, yeah"
I can see it now (See it now)
I'm so glad you made time to see me
"How's life? Tell me, how's your family?"
I haven't seen them in a while
"You've been good, busier than ever"
"We small talk, work and the weather"
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
"You gave me roses, and I left them there to die"
So this is me swallowing my pride
"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright"
I go back to December all the time
"These days, I haven't been sleeping"
"Staying up, playing back myself leaving"
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
"And I think about summer, all the beautiful times"
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
"You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye"
So this is me swallowing my pride
"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
I go back to December all the time
"I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile"
"So good to me, so right"
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
"But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right"
"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't"
"So if the chain is on your door, I understand"
But this is me swallowing my pride
"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright"
"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
I go back to December all the time
Outro
All the time
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
"Out of focus, eye to eye"
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand
1
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
1
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
"And I, I, I like it"
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
"And I will get you, get you alone"
Your name has echoed through my mind
"And I just think you should, think you should know"
That nothing safe is worth the drive
"And I will follow you, follow you home"
"Follow you, follow you home"
2
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
"I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I"
Breakdown
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
"And I will get you, get you alone"
Your name has echoed through my mind
"And I just think you should, think you should know"
That nothing safe is worth the drive

"Follow you, follow you home"
"I'll follow you, follow you home"

Outro
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it
I was reminiscing just the other day
"While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away"
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
"Took off faster than a green light, go"
"Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know"
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
"And darling, it was good"
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
"We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you"""
"And for the first time, I had something to lose"
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
"But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now"
And I see your face in every crowd
"'Cause darling, it was good"
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Hook
"Tonight, I'm gonna dance"
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
"Tonight, I'm gonna dance"
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Outro
"Tonight, I'm gonna dance"
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
"Tonight, I'm gonna dance"
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
"You, with your words like knives"
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
"You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard"
Calling me out when I'm wounded
"You, picking on the weaker man"
"Well, you can take me down"
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
"Someday, I'll be living in a big old city"
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
"You, with your switching sides"
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
"I walk with my head down, trying to block you out"
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know
"Someday, I'll be living in a big old city"
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
"And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life"
"And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean"
Breakdown
"But someday, I'll be living in a big old city"
"And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah"
"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
"Someday, I'll be living in a big old city"
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
"I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind"
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
"One day, we will be remembered"
"I said, remember this feeling"
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
"Screaming, ""This is absurd"""
"'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves"
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
"I was screaming, long live that look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
"One day, we will be remembered"
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Breakdown
Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
"But if, God forbid, fate should step in"
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
"I had the time of my life, with you"
"Long, long live the walls we crashed through"
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
"Singing, long live all the mountains we moved"
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
"And long, long live that look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
"One day, we will be remembered"
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
"With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile"
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said he'd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing)
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?
Breakdown
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
"And they're all standing around me, singing"
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
"Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew"
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Outro
You called me later
"And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it"""
"And I said, ""I'm sorry, too"""
And that was the moment I knew
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
Pre-Chorus 1
"I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about"
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
Pre-Chorus 2
"He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right"
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
"I keep singing, don't know why I do..."
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
"And there he goes, so perfectly"
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Pre-Chorus 
"She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love"
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
"I keep singing, don't know why I do..."
"So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light"
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
"I keep singing, don't know why I do..."
Outro
"He's the time taken up, but there's never enough"
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
 1 Gary Lightbody
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
"In your room, all alone"
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
Pre-Chorus Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody
And right before your eyes
"I'm breaking, no past"
No reasons why
Just you and me

You break my heart in the blink of an eye

 2 Taylor Swift
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better
Pre-Chorus Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody
And right before your eyes
"I'm aching, no past"
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list

"Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket"
"Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late"
"I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket"
"Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait"
We had a beautiful magic love there
"What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"
"In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation"
"We both wake in lonely beds, different cities"
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
"And darling, they all look like me"
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
"What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"
"Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting"
"Silence, the train runs off its tracks"
"Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?"
"Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back"
A beautiful magic love there
"What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful"
"What we had, a beautiful magic love there"
"What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair"
We had a beautiful magic love there
"What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
"Well, count to ten, take it in"
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall"
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
Outro
Your very first day
"Take a deep breath, girl"
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
New to town with a made up name
"In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame"
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
"Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool"
"So overnight, you look like a sixties queen"
Pre-Chorus 1
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
1
"And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
"Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
"But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?"
"Oh, oh, oh"
"Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views"
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
"And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused"
"'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used"
And all the young things line up to take your place
Pre-Chorus 2
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive
1
"And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
"Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
"But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?"
"Oh, oh, oh"
"It was a few years later, I showed up here"
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
"How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out"
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
"And it took some time, but I understand it now"
Pre-Chorus 
‘Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
2
"Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
"Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
"Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh"
"And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
"Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one"
"And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh"
"Oh, whoa, oh, oh"
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
"Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right"
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
"I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show"
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Outro
And the sparks fly
"Oh, baby, smile"
And the sparks fly
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back
Pre-Chorus 1
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?
"It's alright, just wait and see"
Your string of lights is still bright to me
"Oh, who you are is not where you've been"
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
Did some things you can't speak of
"But at night, you live it all again"
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Pre-Chorus 2
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
"When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you"
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?
"It's alright, just wait and see"
Your string of lights is still bright to me
"Oh, who you are is not where you've been"
You're still an innocent
"It's okay, life is a tough crowd"
"2, and still growing up now"
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
"Today is never too late to be brand new, oh"
"It's alright, just wait and see"
Your string of lights is still bright to me
"Oh, who you are is not where you've been"
You're still an innocent
"It's okay, life is a tough crowd"
"2, and still growing up now"
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
Outro
Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back
Intro
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
"Ha, time for a little revenge"
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
"I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him"
"She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause"
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
Pre-Chorus 1
"I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it"
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
"She's an actress, whoa"
She's better known for the things that she does
"On the mattress, whoa"
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind"
"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!"
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
Pre-Chorus 2
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
"Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me"
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
"She's an actress, whoa"
She's better known for the things that she does
"On the mattress, whoa"
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind"
"There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!"
"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey"
"You might have him, but haven't you heard?"
"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey"
"You might have him, but I always get the last word"
"Whoa, whoa-ah-oh"
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
"She's an actress, whoa (she deserved it)"
She's better known for the things that she does
"On the mattress, whoa"
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind"
"There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!"
Outro
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
"'Cause I don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)"
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (no)
"I don't think you do, I don't think you do"
"Let's hear the applause (come on, come on)"
"Come on, show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah?)"
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
"I bet this time of night, you’re still up"
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
"I almost do, I almost do"
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
"‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply"
"I bet it never, ever occurred to you"
That I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
"I almost do, I almost do"
"Oh, we made quite a mess, babe"
It’s probably better off this way
"And I confess, babe"
"In my dreams, you’re touching my face"
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
"I almost do, I almost do"
Outro
"I bet this time of night, you’re still up"
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
"I look around, turn the radio down"
"He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?"""
"I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking"
"How we don't have a song"""
And he says
Our song is the slamming screen door
"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
"The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
"Got to the hallway, well on my way"
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
Our song is the slamming screen door
"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
"The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
"I've heard every album, listened to the radio"
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
"Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window"
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
"The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again
Outro
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel"
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
"Holdin' on, the days drag on"
"Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known"
"That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale"
"I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell"
"This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town"
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
"Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes"
And never really had a chance
"My mistake, I didn't know to be in love"
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
"Happy endings, now I know"
"That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale"
"I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell"
"This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town"
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around
And there you are on your knees
"Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me"
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry
"'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale"
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
"This is a big world, that was a small town"
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Outro
"Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa"
"Try and catch me now, oh"
It's too late to catch me now
There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
"There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car"
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
"In the middle of the parking lot, yeah"
"Oh, yeah"
"We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know"
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
"But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair"
Absentmindedly making me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
"So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town"
"I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat"
You put your eyes on me
"In this moment now, capture it, remember it"
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
"Well, you stood there with me in the doorway"
"My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but"
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
"It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something"
It's fearless
"Oh, yeah"
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
"You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless"
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
"In a storm in my best dress, fearless"
Outro
"Oh, oh"
"Oh, yeah"
Lyrics from Album Review
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
Because I haven't moved in years
And not without my muse
With no one around to tweet it
"I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us"
"How we met, and the sparks flew instantly"
"And people would say, they're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
"'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on"
Pre-Chorus 1
"Oh, a simple complication"
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
"So many walls up, I can't break through"
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
"Yeah, I don't know what to say"
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
"I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us"
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me
Pre-Chorus 2
"Oh, I'm scared to see the ending"
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
"I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how"
I've never heard silence quite this loud
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
"Yeah, and I don't know what to say"
"Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down"
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
"Yeah, and I don't know what to say"
"Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down"
"And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now"
Outro
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
"Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?"
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End
"I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"""
"It was the best night, never would forget how we moved"
The whole place was dressed to the nines
"And we were dancing, dancing"
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
"I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '5"
"Picked me up, late one night at the window"
"We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild"
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
"And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"""
"It was the best night, never would forget how we moved"
The whole place was dressed to the nines
"And we were dancing, dancing"
"Like we're made of starlight, starlight"
"Like we're made of starlight, starlight"
"He said, ""Look at you"
Worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
"If you keep thinking that way"""
"He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me"
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?	27	2012-10-22
11	Red	Starlight 	Don't you dream impossible things?"
"Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"""
"It was the best night, never would forget how we moved"
The whole place was dressed to the nines
"And we were dancing, dancing"
"Like we're made of starlight, starlight"
"Like we're made of starlight, starlight"
"Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy"
"Ooh, ooh, dancing with me"
"Ooh, ooh, we could get married"
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
Guitar Solo
"Oh, my, what a marvelous tune"
"It was the best night, never would forget how we moved"
The whole place was dressed to the nines
"And we were dancing, dancing"
"Like we're made of starlight, starlight"
"Like we're made of starlight, starlight"
Breakdown
"Like we're made of starlight, starlight"
Like we dream impossible dreams
"Like starlight, starlight"
Like we dream impossible dreams
Outro
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?"
Don't you dream impossible things?
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
"And we know it's never simple, never easy"
"Never a clean break, no one here to save me"
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
"And I can't breathe without you, but I have to"
Breathe without you but I have to
"Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt"
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
"And we know it's never simple, never easy"
"Never a clean break, no one here to save me"
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
"It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend"
"Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me"
"It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend"
"Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me"
"And we know it's never simple, never easy"
"Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh"
I can't breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Outro
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry"
"I'm sorry, (Yeah eh) I'm sorry"
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry"
I'm sorry
You said it in a simple way
"AM, the second day"
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
"One last kiss, then catch your flight"
Right when I was just about to fall
Pre-Chorus 1
"I told myself, don't get attached"
"But in my mind, I play it back"
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Pre-Chorus 2
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you
2
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
"In New York, be here"
"But you're in London, and I break down"
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
Outro
"Oh-oh, oh-oh"
I don't wanna miss you like this
"Oh-oh, oh-oh"
"Come back, be here"
"Come back, be here"
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
"Whoa, holding my breath"
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted"
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
"But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead"
"Oh, holding my breath"
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted"
I know
I know
I just know
"You're not gone, you can't be gone, no"
"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
"Can't go back, I'm haunted"
"(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)"
Outro
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it
"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy"
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
"That's fine, you won't mind if I say"
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
"As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn"
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
"As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn"
"And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself"
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
"You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying"
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
"As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn"
Outro
"Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn"
You're just another picture to burn
"Baby, burn"
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
"If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares"
"But right now, my time is theirs"
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
"The jury's out, but my choice is you"
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
"But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine"
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
But this love is ours
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
"And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong"
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you
Breakdown
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
Outro
"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
But this love is ours
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
"I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me"
Were you just kidding?
"'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down"
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
"Baby, what happened? Please tell me"
"'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door"
"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom"
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Was I out of line?
"Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide"
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
"Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure"
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
"Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore"
"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom"
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
"You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so"
"Oh, back up, baby, back up"
Did you forget everything?
"Back up, baby, back up"
Did you forget everything?
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
"Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And  it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
"You said forever and always, yeah"
"I think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again, but I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him, it was losing me."
Intro
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
"Don't say yes, run away now"
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
"And they said ""speak now"""
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you)
"Don't say yes, run away now"
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
"And they said ""speak now"""
"Don't say yes, run away now"
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
"And they said ""speak now"""
Interlude
"Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh"
"Ooh, ooh"
(Say a single vow)
I hear the preacher say
Speak now or forever hold your peace
"There's the silence, there's my last chance"
"I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me"
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
(Hehe!)
"So don't say yes, run away now"
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
"And they said ""speak now"""
 - Variation
And you say
"Let's run away now	78	2010-10-25
12	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Speak Now 	I'll meet you when	79	2010-10-25
12	Speak Now (Deluxe)	Speak Now 	I'm out of my tux at the back door"
"Baby, I didn't say my vows"
So glad you were around when they said
Speak now
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
"I said, ""That's a lie"""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
"And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe"
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is
"When you think Tim McGraw	5	2006-06-19
125	Taylor Swift	Tim McGraw 	I hope you think my favorite song	6	2006-06-19
125	Taylor Swift	Tim McGraw 	Someday you'll turn your radio on	7	2006-06-19
125	Taylor Swift	Tim McGraw 	I hope it takes you back to that place"
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
"Oh, think of me"
Mmmm

Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
"I said, ""That's a lie"""
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
"I threw my phone across the room, at you"
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
"This morning, I said we should talk about it"
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
"And said, ""Okay, let's talk"""
And I said

"Stay, stay, stay"
"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time"
"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
But I think that it's best if we both stay
"Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers"
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

"I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life"

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
"So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light"
"To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret"
"I'd give all I have, honey"
If you could stay like that
"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little"
"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple"
"I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart"
And no one will desert you
"Just try to never grow up, never grow up"
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 1 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little"
"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple"
"No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred"
"And even though you want to, just try to never grow up"
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
"Remember the footsteps, remember the words said"
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
"In a big city, they just dropped me off"
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
"Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up"
I could still be little
"Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up"
It could still be simple
"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little"
"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up"
"Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple"
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
"And even though you want to, please try to never grow up"
"Oh, don't you ever grow up"
"Oh, never grow up, just never grow up"
"The first shots fired, everybody's gathered around"
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
"No, no, it's not what happened at all"
"There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move"
A showdown and I know where to hit you
"But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down"
Now we're standing in the ring
And you made your first swing
And now we're fighting dirty
Won't somebody come say break it up
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
"Baby let's go, oh, oh"
"Let's go, oh, oh"
"So gloves off, if this is how you want it"
"We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise"
"No, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart"
Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
Is she here? Is she's standing on the sidelines?
"Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?"
Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now I'm fighting dirty
But I ain't going down till they break it up
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle

Now we're standing in the ring
Breaking everything that we've been building up so long
And I don't wanna do this break it up
But you're not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like we're going to war

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And I try to not break down crying
No one's gonna give you a medal

Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
"As we danced in the night, remember"
How the stars stole the night away
Ahh-ahh-ahh
"Hey, say that you remember"
"Ai, ai, dancin' in September"
"Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day"
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
"Now, December found the love that we shared in September"
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today
Ahh-ahh-ahh
"Hey, say that you remember"
"Ai, ai, dancin' in September"
"Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day"
Ahh-ahh-ahh
"Hey, say that you remember"
"Ai, ai, dancin' in September"
"Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days"

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
"Intoxicating, complicated"
Got away by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
"And that's the way I loved you oh, oh"
Outro
"And that's the way I loved you oh, oh"
Never knew I could feel that much

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
"The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone"
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong
"You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance"
"It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes"""
"You should've said, ""No"""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
"You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d"
Get back to me (Get back to me)
"And I should've been there, in the back of your mind"
"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
"You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me"
You can see that I've been crying
"Baby, you know all the right things to say"
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
"You say that the past is the past, you need one chance"
"It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes"""
"You should've said, ""No"""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
"You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d"
Get back to me (Get back to me)
"And I should've been there, in the back of your mind"
"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
"You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me"
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
"No no, no, no"
"You should've said, ""No"""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
"You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d"
Get back to me (Get back to me)
"And I should've been there, in the back of your mind"
"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
"You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me"
"Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving"
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
"Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing"
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
"Mmm, I can't help myself"
"Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling"
So I got some things to say to you
"I've seen it all, so I thought"
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
"The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name"
"It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change"
"Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?"
I think you and I should stay the same
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
"Mmm, I can't help myself"
"They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me"
Why aren't you here tonight?
"I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out"
"And pull me near and shine, shine, shine"
"Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons"
Why I should be the one you choose
"All those other girls, well, they're beautiful"
But would they write a song for you?
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
"Mmm, I can't help myself"
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
"Mmm, I can't help myself"

Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself
"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on"
"I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run"
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
"Look now, the sky is gold"
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
"I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger"
"God smiles on my little brother, inside and out"
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
"And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say"
That I had the best day with you today
"Last night, I heard my own heart beating"
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
"I was playing back a thousand memories, baby"
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you
"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
"You would, you would if this was a movie"
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
"Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street"
Flashback to the night when you said to me
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you"
Not before I knew how much I had to lose
"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
"You would, you would if this was a movie"
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
"If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on"
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
 - Variation
"And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like"
You would before you said it's not that easy
"Before the fight, before I locked you out"""
But I take it all back now
"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
"You would, you would if this was a movie"
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
Outro
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you want to see now
"Baby, what about the ending?"
"Oh, I thought you'd be here by now"
Thought you'd be here by now
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
"And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out"
"And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around"
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
"You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know"
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
"You had me crawling for you, honey and it never would have gone away, no"
"You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade"
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
"I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you"
"Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun"
"And when you're close, I feel like coming undone"
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
"You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together"
"Come on, come on, little taste of heaven"
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
"But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun"
"Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone"
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name

"So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together"
"I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places"". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song"

12	Speak Now World Tour Live (Deluxe)	Back to December / Apologize / You’re Not Sorry (Live/2011) 	And then he said, It's too late to apologize"""
It's too late...
"He said, ""It's too late to apologize"""
It's too late...
So this is me swallowing my pride (It's too late to apologize)
"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night (It's too late...)"
"And I go back to December (It's too late to apologize, it's too late)"
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you (It's too late to apologize)
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine (It's too late...)
Oh...
He said you're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
"You're not sorry (no, no, no...)"
You have a way of coming easily to me
"And when you take, you take the very best of me"
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted
"Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
"Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say"
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
"Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
"Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say"
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
"You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you"
"And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you"
(Died for you)
"Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
"So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called ""Blank Space,"" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the ""Oh!"" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called ""Blank Space."""

That's awesome! I love it

Yeah!
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
"But that's not true, 'cause I know you"
Hold on
"Baby, you're losing it"
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
"Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay"
It's not his price to pay
Hold on
"Baby, you're losing it"
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
Hold on
"Baby, you're losing it"
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

"And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you"
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
"You know it's all the same, another time and place"
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
"This revolution, the time will come"
For us to finally win
"And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah"
"Oh, oh"
"So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered"
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
"We're getting stronger now, finding things they never found"
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
"You can walk away, say we don't need this"
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
"This revolution, the time will come"
For us to finally win
"And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah"
"Oh, oh"
"Tonight we stand, get off our knees"
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
"And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives"
But we'll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
"It's a revolution, throw your hands up"
'Cause we never gave in
"And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah"
Hallelujah
"She said, I was seven and you were nine"
I looked at you like the stars that shined
"In the sky, the pretty lights"
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
"Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me"
"You never did, you never did"
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
"Just two kids, you and I"
Oh my my my my
"Well, I was sixteen when suddenly"
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
"And you looked at me, got down on one knee"
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
"After all this time, you and I"
Outro
I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
"In the sky, oh my my my"
"Prologue""These songs were once about my life. They are now about yours."""
"I was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 1, 1989."
"In the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn..."
The debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new?
"For the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before."
"I wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no ""riding off into the sunset,"" like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind. I've learned how to shake things off."
"I've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive."
"I hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for."
From the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love...

"Tall, dark, and superman"
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
"He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition"
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
"I hang on every word you say, yay"
"And you smile and say, ""How are you?”"
"I say, ""Just fine"""
"I always forget to tell you, I love you"
I love you forever
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
"Go save the world, I'll be around"
I watch superman fly away
"Come back, I'll be with you someday"
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
"Tall, dark and beautiful"
"He's complicated, he's irrational"
"But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah"
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
"And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay"
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
"Go save the world, I'll be around"
I watch superman fly away
"Come back, I'll be with you someday"
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
"Don't forget, don't forget about me"
"I'm far away, but I never let you go"
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
"Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be"
Breakdown
"Right here, wishing the flowers were from you"
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day
 - Variation
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
"Go save the world, I'll be around"
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away

I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
Outro
"La, la, la, la, la, la"
"La, la, la, la, la, la"
When you come back down
"I took a chance, I took a shot"
"And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not"
"You took a swing, I took it hard"
And down here from the ground I see who you are
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
"You tell me that you love me, then cut me down"
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
"Yes, I remember what you said last night"
"And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me"
Tell me why
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
"Well, I get so confused and frustrated"
"Forget what I'm trying to say, oh"
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
"You tell me that you want me, then push me around"
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
"Yes, I remember what you said last night"
"And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me"
Tell me why
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
"You tell me that you want me, then cut me down"
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
"You ask me for my love, then you push me around"
Here's to you and your temper
"Yes, I remember what you said last night"
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (why)
Tell me why (why)
Outro
"I take a step back, let you go"
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know
Corey's eyes are like a jungle
"He smiles, it's like the radio"
He whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
"They watch him as he's walking home, saying, ""Does he know?"""
Will you ever know?
You're beautiful
"Every little piece, love"
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
"Oh, but if it don't"
Stay beautiful
Corey finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away
I should say
"Hey, by the way"
You're beautiful
"Every little piece, love"
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
"Oh, but if it don't"
Stay beautiful
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know
You're beautiful
"Every little piece, love"
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my front door
"Oh, but if it don't"
Will you stay
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?"
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?"
Outro
La la la
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
"Oh, but if it don't"
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
"Na, na, na, na, na"
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
"I watch you talk, you didn't notice"
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
"Every time you smile, I smile"
"And every time you shine, I'll shine for you"
"Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby"
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
"Baby, I'm never going to leave you"
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
"I love each freckle on your face, oh"
"I've never been so wrapped up, honey"
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
"I had time to think it oh, over"
And all I can say is come closer
"Take a deep breath, then jump, then fall into me"
"'Cause every time you smile, I smile"
"And every time you shine, I'll shine for you"
"Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby"
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
"Baby, I'm never going to leave you"
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
The bottom's going to drop out from under our feet
"I'll catch you, I'll catch you"
And people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is going to come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
"Whoa oh, I need you baby"
"Don't be afraid, please"
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
"Be there, never going to leave you"
Say that you want to be with me too
So I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall baby
"Jump then fall into me, into me"
Outro
"Every time you smile, I smile"
"And every time you shine, I shine"
And every time you're here
"Baby I'll show you, I'll show you"
"You can jump then fall, jump then fall"
"Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah"
"Once the last drop of rain, has dried off the pavement"
"Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do"
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
"You leave it muddy underneath, reminds me of you"
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
"You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how we used to be"
"Like the dollar in your pocket, that's been spent and traded in"
"You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me"
"I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned"
"Held out, held on"
"God knows, too long, you wasted my time"
"Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here"
No amount of freedom gets you clean
I still got you all over me
Guess the worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
"And your ""don't you wish you had me"" grin"
"I did, so I smile, and I melted like a child"
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of back then
"Well I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned"
"Held out, held on"
"God knows, too long, you wasted my time"
"Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here"
No amount of freedom gets you clean
I still got you all over me
"I lived, and I learned, and found out what it was to turn around"
And see that we were never really meant to be
"So I lied, and I tried, and I watched a part of myself die"
"No amount of freedom, gets you clean"
I still got you all over me
I still got you all over me
Outro
"Na na na, na na na, Na na na, na na na na na"
"Na na na, na na na, na na na, na na na, all over me"
"Na na na, na na na, Na na na, na na na"
"Na na na, all over you, all over me"
"Oh oh oh oh oh yeah, oh oh oh yeah yeah"
Oh oh oh all over me
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
Only you can tell
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
"Well, I'm only me when I'm with you"
With you
Uh huh
Yeah
Prologue
"'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens."
"Real life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything."
"I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help."
"These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world."
"Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone."
"What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest."
"So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’"
"There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it."
I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.
"Love, Taylor"

The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
"You say my name for the first time, baby"
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
"Take me down, baby"
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
"I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would"
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
"I'd love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show"
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Outro
And the sparks fly
"Oh, baby, smile"
And the sparks fly
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
I just want to show you
She don't even know you
She's never going to love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never going to see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be
I just want to show you
She don't even know you
She's never going to love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Like shadows in a faded light
"Oh, we're invisible"
I just want to open your eyes
And make you realize
 - Variation
I just want to show you
She don't even know you
"Baby, let me love you"
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile

I didn't know what I would find
"When I went looking for a reason, I know"
I didn't read between the lines
"And, baby, I've got nowhere to go"
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
"I can still see you, this ain't the best view"
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
"You saw me there, but never knew"
I would give it all up to be
"A part of this, a part of you"
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
"I can still see you, this ain't the best view"
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
"I can still see you, this ain't the best view"
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
"I said, ""This time I've had enough"""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
"I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you"
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
"Screaming, ""I'm in love with you"""
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
"Going through the photographs, staring at the phone"
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
"When I left, I wanted you to chase after me"
"Yeah, I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you"
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
"Screaming, ""I'm in love with you"""
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
"I don't need you but I do, I do, I do"
"I say, ""There's nothing you can say"
"To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"""
What I mean is
"I said, ""Leave,"" but baby all I want is you"
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
"Screaming, ""I'm in love with you"""
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
Outro
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
"And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
After everything and that little black dress
"After everything I must confess, I need you"
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
"Talk to the wind, talk to the sky"
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I’ll leave my window open
‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name
Just know I’m right here hoping
That you’ll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
"And I, I’ve got you down, I know you by heart"
And you don’t even know where I start
"Talk to yourself, talk to the tears"
Talk to the man who put you here
And don’t wait for the sky to clear
I’ll leave my window open
‘Cause I’m too tired at night to call your name
Just know I’m right here hoping
That you’ll come in with the rain
"I’ve watched you so long, screamed your name"
I don’t know what else I can say
But I’ll leave my window open
'Cause I’m too tired at night for all these games
Just know I’m right here hoping
That you’ll come in with the rain
Outro
I could go back to every laugh
But I don’t want to go there anymore
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
"So dim that spotlight, tell me things like"
I can't take my eyes off of you
"I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl"
Who's desperately in love with you
"Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar"
Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name
"So dim that spotlight, tell me things like"
I can't take my eyes off of you
"I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl"
Who's desperately in love with you
"Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar"
"You played in bars, you play guitar"
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
"And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep"
Every night from the radio
"So dim that spotlight, tell me things like"
I can't take my eyes off of you
"I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl"
Who's desperately in love with you
"Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar"
Outro
"Sweet, sweet superstar"
Superstar
"I don't know what I want, so don't ask me"
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
"Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking"
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do
"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
"Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
"Got the radio on, my old blue jeans"
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
"Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine"
Could you tell me what more do I need
"And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah"
But that's OK
"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
"Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly
"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
"Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
"Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
Outro
Oh I'm just a girl
"Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh"
Oh I'm just a girl
"This is another way I've written songs recently. This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me"". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that"". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track"
"Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this"
"It's 2 am, in your car"
"Windows down, past my street the memories start"
It's in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still don't know what I never said
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
"I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I"
"Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good"
I wish you would
Do you like it!?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
"Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall"
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
"No matter what you say, I still can't believe"
That you would walk away
"It don't make sense to me, but"
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break? Why would you wanna break it?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
"But the very next day, you gave it away"
"This year, to save me from tears"
I will give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
"Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me"
"Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it"
"With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it"
Now I know what a fool I've been
"But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again"
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
"But the very next day, you gave it away"
"This year, to save me from tears"
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
"But the very next day, you gave it away"
"This year, to save me from tears"
I will give it to someone special
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
"My God, I thought you were someone to rely on"
"Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on"
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
"But the very next day, you gave it away"
"This year, to save me from tears"
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
"But the very next day, you gave it away"
"This year, to save me from tears"
I will give it to someone special
And last Christmas
And this year
"It won't be anything like, anything like"
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
"But the very next day, you gave it away"
"This year, to save me from tears"
I will give it to someone special

"He said, ""I got me a nice new apartment"
"In the city, wouldn't you have hated that?"
"I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with"""
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
"I'll be here, today and here tomorrow"
In dark blue Tennessee
He was lying when he said he moved to L.A
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just seven miles away
"He's staring out the window and puts her picture down, saying"
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
"I'll be here, today and here tomorrow"
In dark blue Tennessee
She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
"I'll be here, today and here tomorrow"

In dark blue Tennessee
Refrain
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left on my car
I need you now
Words that said drowned out by the rain
"Waiting there for you, but you never came"
My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
"I don't need you, don't need you"
"And I waited, so frustrated"
Who's gonna hold you?
"I don't need you, don't need you now"
Refrain
I need you now
Words I heard you whispered to me
And we will walk you down a one-way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But i'd come too far to go back there again
"My heart, my mind, my mother's a chain"
Your mind as well forget my name
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
"I don't need you, don't need you"
"And I waited, so frustrated"
Who's gonna hold you?
"I don't need you, don't need you now"
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left on my car
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
"I don't need you, don't need you"
"And I waited, so frustrated"
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you now
Outro
And I'm not what you want
I won't wonder where you are
I won't dream a thousand stars
I don't need you now
I don't need you by the rain
And I never heard you say
"I need you, I need you"
I don't need you now
Don't need you
I don't need you now

I could have rolled your yard

With your best friend
He always liked me anyway

He said let's get out of this town
"Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought heaven can't help me now
"Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down"
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
"Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe"
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
He said no one has to know what we do
"His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room"
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me

Who knows why it's gotta be this way?
We say nothing more than we need
"I say ""your place"" when we leave"
"Baby, this is what you came for"
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
"But she's looking at you, oh, oh"
"You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh"
"You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh"
"You, oh, oh, oh, oh"
Taylor's Letter
"This album is called ""Fearless"", and I guess I'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, ""Fearless"" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you'e tried before, you've lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can't breathe without them. I think it's fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say ""you're NOT sorry"", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless"

 1 Long Live
"I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind"
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
 Long Live
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
"One day, we will be remembered"
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
"One day, we will be remembered"
Bridge Long Live
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
And hold on...
To spinning around...
Confetti...
Falls to the ground...
 1 New Year's Day
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
"You and me from the night before, but"
 New Year's Day
Don't read the last page
"But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared"
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
 2 New Year's Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
"I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe"
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
 New Year's Day
Don't read the last page
"But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong"
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
 New Year's Day
"Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you"
"Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you"
"Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you"
And I will hold on to you
Bridge New Year's Day
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
  New Year's Day
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
 New Year's Day
Don't read the last page
"But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared"
And you're turning away

But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Transition Long Live
And Long live
(Please don't ever become a stranger)
The walls we crashed through
(Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
I had the time of my life
(Please don't ever become a stranger)
With you
(Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
Outro Long Live
And Long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you
She walks to school
With her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried
Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too
He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
We're here to die for our God
He stood up and said that's funny
Cause my God died for me
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried
And didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray to oh
The taxis pulled up
On the very day of
They rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down
And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
Where were you
And didn't they pray to
Oh
Outro
I walk to school
And I wear a cross
I'm counting
Every day
"Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze"
Whistle County creek
"Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass"
"Baby, you were watching me"
"Cold barn struck bed, everything you said"
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you
"Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change"
Just like the two of us
"Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket"
Guess I loved you way too much
"But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder"
But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times
I remember
Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
"Said, ""It's really been a while"
"And I still think about back when"""
We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you
Outro
"Oh, that's what I learned from you"
"That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh"
"That's what I learned from you, oh yeah"
Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
"He says ""Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"""
"She says ""Please don't make me go back there again"""
"She said ""I wish there was some way to make them stop it"""
So he drives down to that principal's office and says
"I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down	8	None
197	Unreleased Songs	Brought Up That Way 	I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out	9	None
197	Unreleased Songs	Brought Up That Way 	I live my whole damn life to see that little girl's smile	10	None
197	Unreleased Songs	Brought Up That Way 	So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?	11	None
197	Unreleased Songs	Brought Up That Way 	She wasn't brought up that way"
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
"Oh, but something's different this time"
She doesn't have too much to say
"She said ""He tried but there's just some things I won't do"""
"And through the tears she said ""I couldn't do that to you"""
And he said
"I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down	22	None
197	Unreleased Songs	Brought Up That Way 	Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out	2	None
197	Unreleased Songs	Brought Up That Way 	I live my whole damn life to see my little girl's smile	2	None
197	Unreleased Songs	Brought Up That Way 	So don't let nobody take that away	25	None
197	Unreleased Songs	Brought Up That Way 	You weren't brought up that way"
"The phone rings on a rainy night, says ""It's Officer Tate"""
"He said ""Sir, there's been an accident"
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
"And Emily, she's fading fast"""
"He says ""God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down"
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girl's smile
"So please don't take that away, it won't be easy taking her today"
"She wasn't brought up that way"""
Outro
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes
"Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye"
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
"This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak"
I don't feel welcome anymore
"Baby, what happened? Please tell me"
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
"And you flashback to when he said ""forever and always"""
"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong"
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
"I was there when you said ""forever and always"""
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
"I looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure"
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore
"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
"And you flashback to when he said ""forever and always"""
"And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong"
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
"I was there when you said ""forever and always"""
"You didn't mean it, baby"
"I don't think so, oh oh oh"
"Back up, baby, back up"
Did you forget everything?
"Back up, baby, back up"
Did you forget everything?
"Back up, baby, back up"
"Please back up, oh back up"
"Back up, baby, back up"
"'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong"
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
"I was there when you said ""forever and always"""
"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
"'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong"
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said forever and always
Outro
You didn't mean it baby
"You said forever and always, yeah"
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world’s a little colder now
But I’m keeping warm somehow
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you
I don’t need you don’t need you now
I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street
You need me now
That’s what you’ve been telling my friends
That I’ve come too far to go back there again
My heart my mind and number have changed
You might as well forget my name
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you
I don’t need you don’t need you now
I need you now
Red letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
Outro
And I don’t know where you are
I don’t wonder where you are
I don’t dream about you cause I don’t need you now
I don’t dream about the way
That I never heard you say
“I need you I need you”
I don’t need you now
Don’t need you
Don’t need you now
I don’t think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
"He’ll never fall in love, he swears"
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I’m laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
"He tells a joke, I fake a smile"
But I know all his favorite songs
And I could tell you his favorite color's green
"He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth"
"His sister's beautiful, he has his father’s eyes"
And if you asked me if I love him
I’d lie
He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn’t a light go on?
Doesn’t he know that I’ve had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don’t let nobody see me wishing he was mine
I could tell you his favorite color's green
"He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth"
"His sister's beautiful, he has his father’s eyes"
And if you asked me if I love him
I’d lie
"He stands there, then walks away"
"My god, if I could only say"
I’m holding every breath for you
He’d never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything
But my heart
First thought when I wake up is
"My God, he’s beautiful"
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle
"Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green"
"He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me"
"His sister's beautiful, he has his father’s eyes"
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
I’d lie
"Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me"
"I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby"
So hurry down the chimney tonight
"Santa baby, a '5 convertible, too, light blue"
"Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby"
"So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah"
Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list
"Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that is not a lot"
"I have been an angel all year, Santa baby"
So hurry down the chimney tonight
"Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed"
"To a platinum mine, Santa honey"
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me
"Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing"
A ring
"And I do not mean on the phone, Santa baby"
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Oh won’t  you please let me
Back in your heart?
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
"I wasn’t you back(I want you back), ooh-ooh baby"
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
Oh-woah-oh
Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Won’t  you please let me
Back in your heart?
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
I want you back
Ooh-ooh baby
Intro
I never trust a narcissist
Oh but they love me...
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy...
"'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three"
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about...
...me...
Pre-Chorus 1
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
"If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing"
"I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming"
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
"It just felt so good, good"
"I never trust a playboy, but they love me"
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
"They never see it comin', what I do next"
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left
Pre-Chorus 2
I can feel the flames on my skin
"He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing"""
"But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'"
"And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'"
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
"It just felt so good, good"
It just felt so good
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
"They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons"
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
And it's just for fun
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
"They got pitchforks and proof, they don't need their reasons"
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
"So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)"
"Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)"
"Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)"
Light me up ohh
"Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)"
Light me up ohh
"Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)"
Light me up ohh
"Light me up, light me up, light me up"
Go ahead and light me up...
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
"It just felt so good, good"
Outro

If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me
If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
"You'd be with me, so baby"
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me
It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall
"But here we are in so deep, soaking wet"
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
"Would break this kinda fall, so baby"
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
"You go, I hope you think of me"
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
"This girl is begging wait, wait for me"
We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to
So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me
Outro
Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look now
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I’ve created
I came out alive but I’m black and blue
Pre-Chorus 1
Before you ask me if I’m alright
Think about what I
"Had to do, yeah"
Wake up and smell the breakup
"Fix my heart, put on my makeup"
Another mess I didn't plan
"And I’ll bet, you thought you'd beat me"
Wish you could only see
"I've got an ""I heart question mark"""
Written on the back of my hand
I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home and cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night
Pre-Chorus 2
And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to
Wake up and smell the breakup
"Fix my heart, put on my makeup"
Another mess I didn't plan
"And I’ll bet, you thought you'd beat me"
Wish you could only see
"I've got an ""I heart question mark"""
Written on the back of my hand
And when you're home alone at night
You'll still wonder why
"You took everything I had, oh baby"
I had a lot about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know
Someday you will
Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we won't make up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
"I've got an ""I heart question mark"""
Written on the back of my hand
Outro
Written on the back of my hand
"An ""I heart question mark,"" yeah"
Written on the back of my hand
I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain’t jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
Cause I'm not trying to show maturity
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
"Oh, yeah"
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker
I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess
He found 0 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
"Oh, yeah"
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker
And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
"Oh, yeah"
"Oh, yeah"
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart
X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
"Oh, yeah"
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace

We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus
"You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it"
And we were happy
"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby"
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were going to buy someday
And we were happy
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sort of how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy
"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby"
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were going to buy someday
And we were happy
"Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore"
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
"'Cause we were happy, we were happy"
"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby"
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
"Yeah, we were happy"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh"
We were happy
Lyrics available upon release. Stay tuned!
Spoken Intro
"You know... You guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?"
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
"With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey"
He walks like summer and talks like rain
"Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey"
Since his return from the stay on the moon
"He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey"
Hook 1
"Tell me, did you sail across the sun?"
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights are faded
And that heaven is overrated?
"Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?"
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Now that he's back from that soul vacation
"Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey"
He checks out Mozart while he does Tae-Bo
"Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey"
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
Hook 2
"Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?"
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along in the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
"And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?"
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
"Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken"
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
"Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance"
Five-hour phone conversation
"The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?"

Love Story
Treacherous
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
I had to catch my breath
"When I saw you there across the room, holding her hand"
I'd have never guessed that starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off
And by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way
I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing and come over here to say
I'm looking good
But by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
Outro
"By the way, you still look amazing"
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
"By the way, if you ever wondered"
"Still got the same old number, just in case"
I still miss you and I still love you
By the way
"By the way, oh"
"American boy, living life as it goes"
Sitting on the fence posts
Living in the lie
"American boy, living in the real world"
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy
"Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships"
Looking for the love
"Suddenly rise, an American beauty"
"Suddenly he cheats, sent from above"
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy
"American boy, raising little babies"
"Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you"
"Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn"
"That's grown up, American boy"
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
"No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy"
The hope of an American boy

Verso 1
"Camiseta vintage, celular novíssimo"
Salto alto nos paralelepípedos
"Quando você é jovem, assumem que você não sabe nada"
"Sorriso de lantejoulas, batom preto"
Políticas sensuais
"Quando você é jovem, assumem que você não sabe nada"
Pré-Refrão
Mas eu te conhecia
Dançando em sua calça da Levi's
"Bêbado sob os postes de iluminação, eu"
Eu te conhecia
Mão debaixo do meu moletom
"Querido, beije pra sarar, eu"
Refrão
E quando eu senti que era um cardigã velho
Debaixo da cama de alguém
Você me vestiu e disse que eu era seu favorito
Verso 2
Um amigo de todos não é amigo de ninguém
"Ir atrás de duas garotas, perder a certa"
"Quando você é jovem, assumem que você não sabe nada"
Pré-Refrão
Mas eu te conhecia
"Brincando de esconde-esconde, e"
"Dando-me seus finais de semana, eu"
Eu te conhecia
Seus batimentos cardíacos na High Line
"Uma vez em vinte vidas, eu"
Refrão
E quando eu senti que era um cardigã velho
Debaixo da cama de alguém
Você me vestiu e disse que eu era seu favorito
Verso 
"Beijar dentro de carros, em bares do centro"
Era tudo que precisávamos
Você desenhou estrelas ao redor das minhas cicatrizes
Mas agora estou sangrando
Pré-Refrão
Porque te conhecia
Embarcando no último trem
"Marcou-me como uma mancha de sangue, eu"
Eu te conhecia
Tentei mudar o final
"Peter perdendo Wendy, eu"
Eu te conhecia
Partindo como um pai
"Correndo como água, eu"
"E quando você é jovem, assumem que você não sabe nada"
Ponte
Mas eu sabia que você iria ficar como um beijo de tatuagem
"Eu sabia que você assombraria todos meus ""e se"""
O cheiro de fumaça ficaria todo esse tempo
Pois eu sabia de tudo quando era jovem
Eu sabia que te amaldiçoaria por muito tempo
Perseguindo sombras na fila de supermercado
Sabia que você sentiria minha falta quando a emoção passasse
E você estaria parado na luz da minha varanda
E eu sabia que você voltaria pra mim
Você voltaria pra mim
E eu sabia que você voltaria pra mim
E eu sabia que você voltaria
Refrão
E quando eu senti que era um cardigã velho
Debaixo da cama de alguém
Você me vestiu e disse que eu era seu favorito
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Intermission
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Outro
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
 Bad Blood
"’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood"
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
"’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
"And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
 1 Bad Blood
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
"Baby, I couldn't breathe"
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Pre-Chorus Bad Blood
"Oh, it's so sad to"
Think about the good times
You and I
 Bad Blood
"’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood"
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
"’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
"And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
 2 Bad Blood
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
"Now, did you think it all through?"
All these things will catch up to you
"And time can heal, but this won't"
So if you come in my way
Just don't
Pre-Chorus Bad Blood
"Oh, it's so sad to"
Think about the good times
You and I
 Bad Blood
"’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood"
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
"’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
"And baby, now we've got bad blood"
 Should've Said No
"You should've said, ""No"", you should've gone home"
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
"You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her"
Get back to me (Bad blood!)
"And I should've been there, in the back of your mind"
"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
"You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me"
Bridge Bad Blood
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
"You live like that, you live with ghosts"
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
"If you live like that, you live with ghosts"
"If you love like that, blood runs cold!"
 Bad Blood
"’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood"
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
"’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
"And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"
 Bad Blood
"’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood"

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be
Pre-Chorus 1
I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
Pre-Chorus 2
He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
"And there he goes, so perfectly"
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Pre-Chorus 
She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
Outro
"He's the time taken up, but there's never enough"
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It’s like I’m melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening
Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away
Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can’t take my eyes off you
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
"Oh, baby, here we are"
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
"Oh, this is really happening"
"Oh, oh, baby"
Tell me
You’ll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
"Oh, that this is really happening"
Outro
"Tell me, oh"
You’ll always need me
"(need me, tell me)"
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening
I love you's

I will thank you myself. You have let me into your life, and I will never be able to thank you enough for that. I love YOU, and I love God for putting you in my life"

Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney
"Oh, oh"
"We were babies, we were beautiful and free"
"Oh, oh"
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasn’t been the same since
"That boy she went ran off with, well, I thought he was crazy"
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney
"Oh, oh"
"She was in love, she was beautiful and free"
"Oh, oh"
She was always so much braver than me
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said I’m sorry for waking you up but I didn’t know who else to call
Or where else to go
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney
"Oh, oh"
"We’re not as young, but we’re still beautiful and free"
"Oh, oh"
"Even when we’re old, we’re still going to be"
Outro
Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear
In the summer shade
"What do you say, when you just know"
"That he's the one, and you want to go fast"
But he's taking it slow
"And what do you do, when he's next to you"
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try
"Hey, hey what do you say"
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?
"What do you see, when you look in his eyes"
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
"And what do you feel, when you know its real"
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah
My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say
"Hey, hey what do you say"
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?
What do you say?
Outro
What do you say?
What do you say?
I’m a laid back
"T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring, kinda girl"
"Hey, yeah, what’s the word on you?"
Lay low
"I’m a mission rebel, angel devil"
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental
"But here I am, an open book"
"Turn the page, it’s all the rage"
Get a look on the inside
"Oh, what you get is what you see"
"Baby, you hold the key"
To the diary of me
I’m poetry
"Complicated, simply stated"
"Hey yeah, baby, how about you?"
I was born free
I’m a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
"When I mess up, I don’t get up"
"I just get down, yeah"
"But here I am, an open book"
"Turn the page, it’s all the rage"
Get a look on the inside
"Oh, what you get is what you see"
"Baby, you hold the key"
To the diary of me
It’s raining on Sunday
There’s nothin' on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You’re the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can’t stop thinkin' about you
I bet you’re thinkin' of me too
"Well, here I am, an open book"
"Turn the page, it’s all the rage"
Get a look on the inside
"Oh, what you get is what you see"
"Baby, you hold the key"
To the diary of me
"Yeah, here I am, an open book"
"Turn the page, it’s all the rage"
Get a look on the inside
"Oh, what you get is what you see"
"Baby, you hold the key"
To the diary of me
Angelina’s got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I’ve never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I don’t cause
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
I wasn’t brought up that way
Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
He’s got everything you’d wanna be
"He’s funny, dark and tall"
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won’t cause
Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But ain’t it funny how
It all comes out
Isn’t life sweet?
I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I’m fine just a bit of a mess
And I’m not perfect you could say
You don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone
You don't have to call me
And break my heart
"Each time i try movin on, oh"
"You don't have to call, Anymore"
"Oh, Yeah"
You don't have to call baby
You don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone
You don't have to call me
And break my heart
"Each time i try movin on, oh"
"You don't have to call, Anymore"
"Oh, Yeah"
You don't have to call baby
You don't have to call me
And say you're sorry
I'm already gone
You don't have to call me
And break my heart
"Each time i try movin on, oh"
"You don't have to call, Anymore"
"Oh, Yeah"
You don't have to call baby
Look at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I want to know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
"But baby, never mind"
All the time
Everyday
"There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away"
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you
All I really want to say is I need to be
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
"And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind"
"Yeah, oh yeah"
I could tell you now but never mind
"Yeah, oh yeah yeah"
And I could tell you now but never mind
I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Love’s a little messy and you are too
Right now I’m scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn’t gonna stray
Swore I’d never let a man in my way
You’re the last thing I needed today
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
"Welcome distraction, welcome distraction"
Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can’t talk to my friends
Without you coming up
It’s even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine
You’re the last thing I needed tonight
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
"Welcome distraction, welcome distraction"
I’m acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win so I give in
The more I fight it just get’s stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
"Welcome distraction, welcome distraction"
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
"Yeah I slept, in my makeup again"
Tell myself 'I must be crazy'
Thinkin' 'bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
"About that time, you call me"
"And I'm reminded, without you"
I'd be a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote
I go to work
Work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
"Walk to the car, dig out my keys"
Start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote
There you are
On the street
"Just standing there, waiting on me"
"I show you, my new shoes"
You say you love them
'Nd baby without you -
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote
Outro
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
Sometimes I wonder how it's going to feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
"Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl"
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
"Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain"
"Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love"
I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other
It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I want to find
A love that's going to last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
"Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain"
"Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game"
"Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars"
"Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love"
It was something like a perfect start to
This love yesterday but now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes know how to look right through me
"It's like, you forgot the words you whispered to me"
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you
"Could you tell me, what did i do"
Because it can't be
We're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me
Is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
"Take time, to realise I know that"
People change their minds
But that was something i wished you would say
To my face
But you ran away
"Could you tell me, what did i do"
Because it can't be
We're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me
Is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
If i had a reason
Or a simple goodbye
Baby even a lie
"Yeah, yeah"
"Tell me, what did i do"
Because baby
Suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool
After you held me
Is that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me
And tell me
Oooh yeah
Tell me
Tell me
"Let me know, how's it feel"
"To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart"
Is it like anywhere you've been?
"And everything I do, I do it just for you"
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
"But I was just a toy, which you destroyed"
Stupid boy
"I have been looking in, trying to read your mind"
"Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time"
"And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside"
Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
"But I was just a toy, which you destroyed"
Stupid boy
"What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?"
"You take one look at me, cause that's what it cost"
I just wanna be everything you need
Cause you're everything to me
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
"But I was just a toy, which you destroyed"
Stupid boy
Outro
"Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin"
Please take down the mistletoe
Because I don't want to think about that right now
Because everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
"My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me"
"Season's greetings, hope you're well"
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine
"I've been doing fine without you, really"
Up until the nights got cold
"And everybody's here, except you, baby"
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold
But for me it's just a lonely time
Because there were Christmases when you were mine
"Merry Christmas, everybody"
That will have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Outro
You were mine
I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything
If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one will be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes
It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
If that's what you need

All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found
"Ooh, life's so sweet right here"
"Ooh, keeping it young and crazy"
"Ooh, just want to stay right here"
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
"Oh, I can't leave yet"
"Ooh, life's so sweet right here"

What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
"Tell me, what would you find?"
You'd see that today holds something special
"Something holy, not superficial"
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
"Tell me, what would you find?"
You'd see that today holds something special
"Something holy, not superficial"
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind
Is that the day holds something special
"Something holy, not superficial"
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something

You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin'
Really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
"But, baby, I was betting on you"
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
"I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's ""I told you so"""
"But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack"
"I said, ""let them say we're crazy,"" you said, ""let's go fishing tonight"""
"The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was looking into your eyes"
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
"I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's ""I told you so"""
"But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack"
Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me
I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback

You ain't never been through that
"You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack"

Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street?
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me?
And I threw the remote at you
"And you said ""my point exactly"""
"And later on that night, under the neon city lights"
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
"The moment we meet, there was never a doubt"
That we won't forget this Sunday
"It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles"
And it all leads to this - our first kiss
All my friends are saying
"Girl, what are you thinking?"
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
"Girl, that boy is trouble"
"You're better off, you're better off"
"They can talk forever, they just don't know better"
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone
All my friends are saying
"Girl, why are you crying?"
"You're better off, you're better off without him"
Find yourself another
"Girl, that boy is trouble"
"You're better off, you're better off"
"They can talk forever, they just don't know better"
You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way
All my friends are saying
"Girl, what are you thinking?"
"You're better off, you're better off without him"
Find yourself another
"Girl, that boy is trouble"
"You're better off, you're better off"
"Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better"
I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you
I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds
And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do
I'll keep writing songs about you
"According to my birth certificate, I turn 0 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 28, but the actual age I currently am is 29. I've heard people say that your thirties are ""the most fun!"" So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned before reaching 0, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring."
Lesson 1
"I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren’t, how you’re failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I’m showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I’m training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. I’m also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to “go die in a hole ho” while I’m having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it’s healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once."
Lesson 2
"Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life’s worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you."
Lesson 
"Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, it’s good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It’s especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That’s GOOD. We’ll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That’s not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you’ll learn from it. Then you’ll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it’s fine; do you, you’re searching."
Lesson 
"I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day."
Lesson 5
"Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn’t cruel. It’s just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it."
Lesson 6
"I’ve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren’t allowed to age. It’s an impossible standard to meet, and I’ve been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we’re supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn’t even remotely required of men."
Lesson 7
"My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep  million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I’ve ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I’ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears."
Lesson 8
"I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was “couples goals” based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn’t real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want."
Lesson 9
"I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm’s cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016."
Lesson 10
"I’ve always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I’ll be making at dinner parties for life Ina Garten’s Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawson’s Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver’s Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what I’m pretty sure the internet would call a “weird flex.”)"
Lesson 11
"Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I’d hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape."
Lesson 12
"Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it’s so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say “I’m sorry, but...” and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships."
Lesson 1
"It’s my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying “This happened to me.” It’s something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don’t."
Lesson 1
"When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you’ve never dealt with before, it’s okay to say that you don’t know what to say. Sometimes just saying you’re so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It’s okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don’t have all the answers. However, it’s not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they’re at their lowest point. Even if you can’t really help the situation, it’s nice for them to know that you would if you could."
Lesson 15
"Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy."
Lesson 16
"Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don’t know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn’t gold, and first impressions actually aren’t everything. It’s impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a “solid first 15”), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they’ve seen you broken? Or after they’ve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they’re people? These are things a first impression could never convey."
Lesson 17
"After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can’t I be soft during all the seasons?!"
Lesson 18
"Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It’s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them."
Lesson 19
"Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you’re shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess."
Lesson 20
"Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about “we’re in our young twenties!” hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they’ll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It’s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you’ll always keep the memories."
Lesson 21
"Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don’t look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you’re doing it wrong. See Bleachella."
Lesson 22
"How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you’re not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren’t trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there’s a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who “won” the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say “Hey, same team.” Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don’t give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers."
Lesson 2
"I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don’t care if I’m #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they’re here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I’ll never forget the ones who stuck around."
Lesson 2
"I’ve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It’s taught me that there are real problems and then there’s everything else. My mom’s cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now."
Lesson 25
"I remember people asking me, “What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?” There’s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I’m really grateful to have learned this isn’t true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool."
Lesson 26
"I make countdowns for things I’m excited about. When I’ve gone through dark, low times, I’ve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (they’re free) and adding things I’m looking forward to. Even if they’re not big holidays or anything, it’s good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it’s good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things."
Lesson 27
"I learned that disarming someone’s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I’ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I’ve ever felt in my life, but I can’t tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 6-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It’s the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll’s hateful Instagram comment with “lol.” It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I’ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it."
Lesson 28
"I’m finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 0 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 11 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I’m going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year."
Lesson 29
"I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It’s the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they’ve left me. Please pray for their safe return."
Lesson 0
"My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I’d lock myself in my room and couldn’t forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I’ve made a mistake, whether it’s self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I’ve come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go."

Something about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard
"To talk, walk, think, stop"
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me
You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard
"To talk, walk, think, stop"
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me
Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
"It wasn't our song, it was yours"
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than
"To talk, walk, think, stop"
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me
My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kind of scared cause
I've never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
Cause I'm going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do
My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year
James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been oas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on
And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do
"She didn't have a reason to go, oh no"
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
"I just drive on by, just south of knowing why"
I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
"She felt so out of touch, because  she just felt too much"
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
"I just drive on by, just south of knowing why"
"I don't have a plan, I don't have a map"
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by
"I just drive on by, drive on, drive on"
Drive all night
"If I drive on, drive on, drive on"
"Drive all night, just south of knowing why"
I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time
I patched your dents
Smiled at your friends
Which apparently is a crime
I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her
But life's too long
To waste it all loving a liar
And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down
I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song
Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines long
And don't you tell me
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl
She died from complications
Of the things you told her
So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down
Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
"Well I say, cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver"
Just a few I've thought of
And when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
"Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down"
"Matches, now"
"If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon"
And maybe this will be enough
"I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know"
"That, baby, perfect have I loved"
Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you?
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek?
"'Cause, baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me, sayin'"
"If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon"
And maybe this will be enough
"I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know"
"That, baby, perfect have I loved"
I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet
"And if you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon"
And maybe this will be enough
"I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know"
"That, baby, perfect have I loved"
"Love was all we knew, and faith was growing on the vines"
"Words were all we had, and for one summer, you were mine"
Sayin'
"If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon"
And maybe this will be enough
"I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least I'll know"
"That, baby, perfect have I loved"
 One
I walk in the room there's a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I don't know what to say
"Hello, good day"
"But what I do know, is that tonight is gonna be the night, when"
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
"When, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid"
"When, I'll say, oh, I'll say I love him too"
"And, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade"
Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio
"And, he says he really loves me too, he'll do anything"
 Two
"Oh, I walk through the door there's a beautiful moonlight shine"
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin' what I did today
With him
"But what I do know, is that, I love him too"
And the next time I see
Him walking down the street(down the street)
"I'll think about this time, that was as beautiful as sunshine, oh"
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
"Yeah, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid"
"And I'll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you"
"Oh, I'll say, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade"
"Then he'll drive me home, listenin' to the radio"
"Then, he says, he really loves me and he'll do anything"
"I look in his brown eyes, and see a surprise"
It's like a present that you open
"Oh, and do you know, oh, do you know"
What that surprise is?
It's love
"And the next time I see him walking down the streets in his old white T-shirt, I'll always remember"
"This time, that was as beautiful as sunshine"
Outro
"Oh, oh, oh, sunshine, oh, oh, oh, sunshine"
"Sunshine, sunshine, was as beautiful as sunshine"

My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you
He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I want to do is say
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you
I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said
Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you
Outro
I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye
Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
"And then reality crept in, and erased it"
For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
"And you don't know it, do you?"
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly
Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
"I tried to catch you, but I can't"
Chase the wind
And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
"And you don't know it, do you?"
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly
I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
"And you don't know it, do you?"
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

"Oh, and here's to my real friends"
"Oh, and here's to my baby"
They didn't care about the he-said-she-said
"We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"
 1 TIWWCHNT
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
Pre-Chorus TIWWCHNT
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates
 TIWWCHNT
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling"
Because you break them
I had to take them away
"This is why we can't have nice things, honey"
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things
 2 TIWWCHNT
It was so nice being friends again
"There I was, giving you a second chance"
But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
Pre-Chorus TIWWCHNT
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
If only you weren't so shady
Bridge TIWWCHNT
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said-she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
"Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face"
 TIWWCHNT
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (darling)"
Because you break them
I had to take them away
"This is why we can't have nice things, honey"
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling"
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
(And here's to my baby)
"This is why we can't have nice things, darling"
(He didn't care about that he-said-she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don’t offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go
These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if they’re half as stubborn as me
They’ll just keep on shining bright
I ain’t ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ain’t strong
I’ll just move on
And leave this in my past
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I’ll act today
Until you find somebody new
So I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it
Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don’t know
Oh and it troubles me so
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I’ll feel today
I see you found somebody new
And I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it
Repeat Chorus
Outro
Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile
I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better
All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you
If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure
Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby
Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you
And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making
Becasue if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure
Outro
I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever
"Here I am, once again"
"In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving"
I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
"So goodbye, it's not goodnight"
Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'
"Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart"
"Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car"
Caught a red light I ran right through
"Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you"
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
"You got me, you do"
"In a daze, pull the shades"
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
"I relax, I go back to all the things you said"
That only I know
I'm runnin' right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
It's only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time
What a thing to see
What a thing to be
"What a perfect love, what a perfect home"
'Cause every time she walks
And every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on
But whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone
"And he says, ""Sugar, how I love you"
"How I think about you all the time"""
"He calls her ""Sugar"" 'cause she's the sweetest thing"
"Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find"
With her midnight hair
And with his favorite stare
"She's a southern belle, he's a rockout king"
When she looks around
"Oh, she knows she's found"
"Such a perfect life, such a perfect thing"
And whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone
"And he says, ""Sugar, how I love you"
"How I think about you all the time"""
"He calls her ""Sugar"" 'cause she's the sweetest thing"
"Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find"
"Oh, there's a reason for every season"
There's a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far
"And he says, ""Sugar, how I love you"
"How I think about you all the time"""
"He calls her ""Sugar"" 'cause she's the sweetest thing"
"Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find"
"He calls her ""Sugar"""
Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand
And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights
1
I've seen a million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights
Still through the haze I can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights
2
I've played a thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights
I've walked a thousand miles
Smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights
Outro
So walk with me as the sweet wind dances
I'll write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights
I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine!
"Oh, honey baby, oh"
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
"Except you, honey baby!"
Oh!
"Flying high, I can see his smiling"
As we walk down by the drives
"Take my hand, take my breath away"
Cause you make me feel like flying!
"Oh, you are everything I'll ever need"
"Oh, you are everything I wanna be!"
"Drive me crazy, have me baby"
All I really wanna say is

She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
"School dance, first chance"
Always been a dreamer
"There's one guy, she's shy"
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it
"Blue dress, angel face"
Looking in the mirror
"Shoes, purse, hair tied back"
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air
"Peace, love"
One thing leads into another
"Dream big, aim small"
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear
She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
"First date, can't wait"
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it
"Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt"
"Shoes, purse, hair tied back"
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air
The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again
"Move out, find out"
Where the world can take her
"Bright lights, late nights"
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer
"Peace, love"
One thing leads into another
"Dream big, aim small"
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear
Outro
"Oh, oh, oh"
Wondering what to wear
Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly
Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what I’m proud of
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly
And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart
‘Cause I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
I’m living in a brand new world
And you think I’m just another girl
But I’m living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I’m gonna fly

Verso 1 Justin Vernon
"Eu posso te ver, querida"
Com os braços dele ao redor de seu corpo
"Rindo, mas a piada não é nem um pouco engraçada"
E demorou cinco minutos inteiros
Pra nos embrulhar e me deixar
Segurando todo esse amor aqui no corredor
Refrão Justin Vernon
Acho que vi esse filme antes
E não gostei do final
Você não é mais minha terra natal
Então o que estou defendendo agora?
"Você era minha cidade, agora estou exilado, te acompanhando até a saída"
Acho que vi esse filme antes
Pós-Refrão Justin Vernon
"Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Verso 2 Taylor Swift
"Eu posso te ver encarando, querido"
Como se ele fosse apenas seu substituto
Como se você fosse trocar socos por mim
"Segunda, terceira, e centésima chances"
Se balançando em galhos quebradiços
Esses olhos somam insulto à injúria
Refrão Taylor Swift
Acho que vi esse filme antes
E não gostei do final
Eu não sou mais seu problema
Então quem estou ofendendo agora?
"Você era minha coroa, agora estou exilada, te acompanhando até a saída"
Acho que vi esse filme antes
Então estou saindo pela porta lateral
"Ponte Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & ambos"
"Então vá embora, não tem quantidade"
De lágrimas que possa chorar por você
Todo esse tempo
Sempre andamos em uma linha muito frágil
Você nem ao menos me escutou (Você nem ao menos me escutou)
Você nunca deu um sinal de aviso (Eu dei tantos sinais)
Todo esse tempo
Eu nunca aprendi a ler sua mente (Nunca aprendeu a ler minha mente)
Eu não consegui virar o jogo (Você nunca virou o jogo)
Porque você nunca deu um sinal de aviso (Eu dei tantos sinais)
"Tantos sinais, tantos sinais"
Você nem ao menos viu os sinais
"Refrão Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift"
Acho que vi esse filme antes
E não gostei do final
Você não é mais minha terra natal
Então o que estou defendendo agora?
"Você era minha cidade, agora estou exilado, te acompanhando até a saída"
Acho que vi esse filme antes
Então estou saindo pela porta lateral
"Saída Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift"
"Então vá embora, não tem quantidade"
De lágrimas que possa chorar por você
Todo esse tempo
Sempre andamos em uma linha muito frágil
Você nem ao menos me escutou (Você nem ao menos me escutou)
Você nunca deu um sinal de aviso (Eu dei tantos sinais)
Todo esse tempo
Eu nunca aprendi a ler sua mente (Nunca aprendeu a ler minha mente)
Eu não consegui virar o jogo (Você nunca virou o jogo)

Você nunca deu um sinal de aviso (Todo esse tempo)

There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
"Live forever, never say never"
"You could do better, that's what she says"
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
"A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite"
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
"And she says lucky you, lucky you"
"She sings her little song, she walks along"
A little pathway headed for the skies
"Left to travels, lives they unravel"
"Mind over matter, that's what she says"
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
"A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite"
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
"And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you"
Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
"Honey she'll love you, funny how some view"
Angels above you aren’t so far away
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
"A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite"
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
"And she says lucky you, lucky you"
I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room
And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?
I don't want to lose your face
And I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
And I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now I wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?
That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim
Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star
Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
"When it comes to you, oh"
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star
The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see
And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star
Outro
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim
Time is passing slowly for the eight year old next door
But mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
But girls could say he's just a bit too tall
You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it
Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view
He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see
You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it
Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view
In the least or masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all they never call
But don't think that they weren't wishing
Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view
It's all in your point of view
Point of view
It's all in your point of view
Fearless
There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
"Hey, Soul Sister"
"Hey, hey, hey"
Fearless
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you
Fearless
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why when with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
"Hey, Soul Sister"
"Hey, hey, hey"
Fearless
So baby drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
You put your eyes on me
"In this moment now, capture it, remember it"
Fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
I'm Yours
"But I won't hesitate no more, no more"
"It cannot wait, I'm yours"
"Hey, Soul Sister"
"Hey, hey, hey"
Fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
"One daybreak, one heartache"
Every once-upon-a-time
"That black dress, happiness"
Bubble baths and quarter lines
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
"A blue bonnet, a braid on it"
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
"Your black boots, my red flower ring"
Live for the little things
Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
"One last stands, new romance"
Living for that love and person
"Ohh, yeah"
Ohh
"No fighting, black riding"
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
"Pretending, defending"
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things
Outro
Na na na...
"Oh, yeah"
Na na na...
"Ohh, yeah"
Na na na...
I need you more than I know how to mention
And I'd give forever to get your attention
Be you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night
"Ooh, ooh, love's like this"
It's something I missed
"Ooh, ooh, love's like this"
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love
All of the days that I couldn't get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life
Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby I've got mine
To give you everything you dream about
Repeat Chorus
"I loved you for a little, a little while"
I think you know that!
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you...
It's not like you to be here
When you said you won't!
But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
It's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
It kills me to say this
"It really does, it kills my heart!"
But I might still love you
Reason we're just fallen apart
But it's not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind!
"But in the pouring rain, You changed everything"
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
And it's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
"Oh, am I..."
All I torn myself I would be losing!
"But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?"
My tears are falling down from the sky!
"In the pouring rain, I can feel..."
I wonder who you love tonight
"Oh, in the pouring rain"
In the pouring rain
"Oh, in the pouring rain!"
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mind
You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shining boots and your full on band
"A smile on your face, a knife in your hand"
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands
But don't ruin yourself I aren’t your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intention
Hook
I want to talk about what you are that I aren’t
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been
I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
"I tell them, ""this is what I do"""
And it’s what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
And say life on musical road is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition
Hook
I want to talk about what you are that I aren’t
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been
Let's talk about your childhood days
"You were the prom queen, I was on this stage"
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games
Hook
So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
"Let's talk about what you want to be, girl, and who I've always been"
          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        
I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
"And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall"
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going
"I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights"
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going
A long time going
"And it will be a long time, long time going"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh"
"It will be a long time, long time going, going"
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh"
Like one of those fireflies
"Oh, it looks so good till it's in your hand"
It's like one of those memories
Where you can't let go but you just can't stand
It's like one of those crazy dreams
And the permanent screens in the magazines
"Saying, ""why'd I love?"
"All it does is break your heart"""
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
"In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time"
"Love or lie, live or die"
"I, well, I guess that's life"
Like one of those people
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
It's like one of those stories
Where the hero dies in the very last race
Like one of those endless cries
And the crazy lies of a hurting child
"Saying,""why did love have to hurt?"
"It broke my heart"""
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
"In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time"
"Love or lie, live or die"
"I, well, I guess that's life"
I always liked to think
That I was always brave enough
To try to master any push and shove
Well I guess I never qualified love
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
"In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time"
"Love or lie, live or die"
"I, well, I guess that's life"
"Oh, I guess that's life"
"Well, I guess that's life"
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
"I wanna be your end game, end game"
"Big reputation, big reputation"
"Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah"
"And you heard about me, ooh"
I got some big enemies
"Big reputation, big reputation"
"Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah"
"And I heard about you, ooh"
"You like the bad ones, too"
"You like the bad ones, too"
You like the bad ones
"I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be"
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you like the other girls do
"I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be"
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
"I know what they all say, yeah"
But I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
"I wanna be your end game, end game"
"I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't"
"And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em"
"Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy"
"I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me"
"And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul"
"It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold"
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips
"Big reputation, big reputation"
"Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah"
"And you heard about me, ooh"
I got some big enemies
"Big reputation, big reputation"
"Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah"
"And I heard about you, ooh"
"You like the bad ones, too"
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
"I wanna be your end game, end game"
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
"I wanna be your end game, end game"
On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
"Well, it's quite not London"
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by
You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July
And it's safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville
I'm going back to Nashville
Going back to Naaaaahh....
Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?
"Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out"
"Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down"
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
"There was something wrong, it was all my fault"
"I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now"
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose
Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside?
"He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind"
"And I lied, I swore that everything was fine"
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
"There was something wrong, it was all my fault"
"I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now"
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose
I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
"There was something wrong, it was all my fault"
"I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now"
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose
Outro
"Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out"
Are you trying to make me fall?
"'Cause with a face like that, baby"
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you"
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer"
"Oh, oh, I love you I love you"
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head
Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me
See the train is coming for me
"Help me, save me from this crash at last"
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you"
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer"
"Oh, oh, I love you I love you"
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head
Na na na na na na na na na na na
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you"
"Ooh, ooh I really really want you"
"Oh, oh I love you I love you"
"Oh, oh.."
Spoken Intro
"There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA, did you know that?"
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I’m such a fan of and
"I’d love to play you  some music I’m a fan of that’s come from LA, is that okay?"
"This one came out in 1981 8 years before I was born and I love this song, it’s called “Bette Davis Eyes”"
Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She’s  got Bette Davis eyes
1
And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She’s  got Bette Davis eyes
2
She'll expose you
And just knows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
"What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy,ayy)"
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes
I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Don’t try me
Don’t fight me
You be you and I’ll be me
They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you
Your mom and daddy’s walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
"So sorry, don’t worry"
I’m sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do
They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you
"Oh baby, don’t persuade me"
I know that you ain’t used to no
So let me say it real slow
They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you
They say I’ve always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it’s true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain’t you
It wasn't just like a movie
"The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin"
"I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say"
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
"Cause I, I still love you but I can't"
"Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side"
"Bye, bye, baby"
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
"From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah"
The picture frame is empty
"It's black and white, you're smiling down at me"
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past
"Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side"
"Bye, bye, baby"
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like your slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends
"Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side"
"Bye, bye, baby"
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
"Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side"
"Bye, bye, baby"
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
"From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah"
There was one thing I knew would never leave me
Outro
It wasn't just like a movie
"The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin"
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
"And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like"
"And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
"You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt"
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
"And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
"Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights"
"Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise"
"Fade into view, oh"
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
"And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like"
"And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
"You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt"
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
"And when we go crashing down, we come back every time"
"'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
Let me hear you please make some noise for my band
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know
"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
And I was crying on the staircase
"Begging you, please, don't go"
Give it up for my guitarist LA!

"Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night"
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
"Right here right now, I feel it on my skin"
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain
In through the window I see her with you
"I’m soaked to the skin, you’re warm and dry"
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain
All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling…
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
"Right here right now, I feel it on my skin"
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain
Down came the rain
I don’t need a lot
But there is one thing
Love has taught me
It’s to never expect too much
Don’t need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you
"And I might, I found life"
Why should we be wasting time?
You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view
Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer’s eve
No offense to them but they ain't got nothing on you
Walking with you
In the light or in the dark
Well nothing shadows who you are
And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view
I look outside the window
Everyday see something new
But all I ever wanted was a
"Window looking at you, at you"
And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view
I’ve been counting days and
I’ve been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I don’t want to jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
Dreaming of you baby
I’ve been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
‘Cause I’ve been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you
I don’t want to jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if you’ve seen one
I’d like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one
 x2
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight
 I
... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight
You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light
Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight
Outro
I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
If I could be sweet
"I would but first of all, let me say"
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
Its your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
"Forever, perfectly together"
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
"Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl"
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
"Sweet escape, sweet escape"
You let me drown
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
"Come on, let's bounce"
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground
Oh baby
Times been getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
"Hopefully, you don't leave me"
Wanna take you with me
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
"Forever, perfectly together"
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
"Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl"
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
"Sweet escape, sweet escape"
Isn't it funny how many times we can say
"We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page"
And moved on
That's what we thought
But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
"Uh oh, uh oh"
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I may see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Fall back on you
You always let someone come in between
Your talking round the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time
Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
"But just, baby, get along with me"

"Letra de ""Taylor Swift - my tears ricochet (Tradução em Português)"""
Verso 1
"Nos juntamos aqui, nos alinhamos, chorando num quarto iluminado pelo sol"
"E se eu estou em chamas, você será feito de cinzas, também"
"Até no meu pior dia, será que eu mereci, querido"
O jeito como você me infernizou?
"Porque eu te amei, eu juro que te amei"
Até o dia de minha morte
Refrão
Eu não tinha em mim o necessário para partir graciosamente
"E você é o herói voando por ai, livrando sua cara"
"E se eu morri para você, porque você está no velório?"
"Xingando meu nome, desejando que eu ficasse"
Veja como minhas lágrimas ricocheteiam
"Nós juntamos pedras, sem nunca saber o que elas irão significar"
"Algumas para jogar, algumas para fazer um anel de diamante"
Você sabe que eu não queria ter que te assombrar
Mas que cena fantasmagórica
Você usa as mesmas joias que eu te dei
Em quanto me enterra
Refrão
Eu não tinha em mim o necessário para partir graciosamente
"Porque quando eu lutava, você me dizia que eu era corajosa"
"E se eu morri para você, porque você está no velório?"
"Xingando meu nome, desejando que eu ficasse"
Veja como minhas lágrimas ricocheteiam
Ponte
E eu posso ir para onde eu quiser
"Para onde eu quiser, só não para casa"
"E você pode mirar no meu coração, tirar sangue"
Mas você ainda sentiria minha falta nos seus ossos
E eu ainda falo com você (Quando estou gritando para o céu)
E quando você não consegue dormir à noite (Você ouve minhas canções de ninar roubadas)
Refrão
Eu não tinha em mim o necessário para partir graciosamente
E então os encouraçados se afundam sob as ondas
"Você tinha que me matar, mas isso te matou de qualquer jeito"
"Xingando meu nome, desejando que eu ficasse"
Você se tornou seus piores medos
"E você está desviando da culpa, bêbado nessa dor"
Riscando os bons anos
"E você está xingando meu nome, desejando que eu ficasse"
Veja como minhas lágrimas ricocheteiam
Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were calling my name
When your face faded from view
Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?
"Angels fly, in the air tonight"
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night
Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
"You meant more to me then, than you ever knew"
"You were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar"
Hope the the world never tore that out of you
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the Indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and martin singing
I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane
Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night
"Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah, oh"
"Days go by, I wonder if you hear me"
Can't you read between the lines?
"Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing"
"Take this chance, I'll make you mine"
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
"I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around"
And all I see is someone I don't know
"Love's got me tangled, tired me too"
"No sign of a wall, sign of wall"
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
"He tells lies, are you really thinking"
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
"Don't ask how, but fate decides"
Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it
Outro
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you
Spinning me around
And all I see is you
I'm still wearing my blue jeans
No I don't know what you mean
I'm still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
I've always been the same girl
Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun
I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
I've always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
I've always been the same girl
Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun
I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking...
I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl
Spoken Intro
"So, we're gonna have the band take a little tiny break and I'm gonna play you a song that, uh, I wrote this when I was like thirteen years old and just moved to Nashville, and I knew that I wanted to end up making music and on a record label, but I didn't know how I was going to get there. And I wrote this song about it"
"I don't know what I want, so don't ask me"
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
"Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking"
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do
"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
"Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
"Got the radio on, my old blue jeans"
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
"I'm feeling lucky today, got the sunshine"
Could you tell me what more do I need
"And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah"
But that's OK
"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
"Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
Guitar Solo
"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"

"Letra de ""Taylor Swift - the 1 (Tradução em Português)"""
Verso 1
"Eu estou bem, fazendo coisas novas"
"Tenho dito ""sim"" ao invés de ""não"""
"Pensei ter te visto no ponto de ônibus, mas não vi"
Eu trabalhei duro toda noite
Eu fui na matinê de Domingo
Você sabe que os melhores filmes de todos os tempos nunca foram feitos
Pré-Refrão
"Acho que você nunca sabe, você nunca sabe"
"E se você me queria, realmente deveria ter aparecido"
"E se você nunca sangrar, jamais crescerá"
E está tudo bem agora
Refrão
"Mas nós eramos algo, você não acha?"
"Loucos anos 20, jogando moedas na piscina"
E se meus desejos se realizassem
Seria você
"Em minha defesa, não tenho nenhuma"
Por nunca deixar nada quieto
Mas seria divertido
Se você fosse o cara certo
(Ooh)
Verso 2
Eu tive esse sonho em que você fazia coisas legais
Tendo suas próprias aventuras
Você conhece uma mulher na internet e à leva pra casa
"Nunca colorimos pelos números, querido"
Mas fazíamos contar
Você sabe que os maiores amores de todos os tempos já acabaram
Pré-Refrão
"Acho que você nunca sabe, você nunca sabe"
E é outro dia acordando sozinha
Refrão
"Mas nós eramos algo, você não acha?"
"Loucos anos 20, jogando moedas na piscina"
E se meus desejos se realizassem
Seria você
"Em minha defesa, não tenho nenhuma"
Por nunca deixar nada quieto
Mas seria divertido
Se você fosse o cara certo
Ponte
"Eu, eu, eu persisto e resisto a tentação de te perguntar"
Se uma coisa fosse diferente
Tudo seria diferente agora?
Refrão
"Mas nós eramos algo, você não acha?"
Tomando Rosé com a família que você escolheu
E seria doce
Se pudesse ser eu
"Em minha defesa, não tenho nenhuma"
Por revirar o túmulo outra vez
Mas seria divertido
Se você fosse o cara certo
(Ooh)

I said I know
"He said need some time, need some space"
To think about all of this
I watched him go
He watched me crushed to the floor
"On my knees, just like that"
"He said, ""When can I come back?"""
"I said, that's when I wake up in the morning"
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when never see your face
"I let you in, baby that's when"
I said I know
"He said I did you wrong, made mistakes"
Put you through all of this
"'Cause I let you go, you let me think"
That I'll be fine without you
Imagine that!
So baby I'll come back
And I said all this playing
Did you ever think of me?
And he said
Outro
I said I know
"He said I need some time, need some space"
I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that’s good enough for me
Don’t need the real thing
That’s just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don’t know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be a riding off with him
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me
It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I’ll never look
At a sunset the same night
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me

He's got a nice little life
"He's gonna live it, but on"
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
"Painted red, and he said"
It's not the best I know
"But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine"
People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
"Oh yeah, mandolin"
"Got a car, got a scar"
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
"Got his problems, bills to pay"
Somehow that boy finds a way
"Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah"
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
"Oh yeah, mandolin"
Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
"Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin"
Mandolin
"Oh, mandolin"
Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You
You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got
I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good
Oh oh
Outro
Made Up You
Oh oh
Made Up You
Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
"I'm heading out tonight, traveling light"
I'm gonna start all over again
And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
"When freedom was waiting, down at the station"
All I had to do was make up my mind
"Well, I have walked through the fire"
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out
Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
"Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings"
"Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything"
"? bad days, tell me, I'll ?"
? look so sad? You feel ?
? know you thought you had it
I know all about that
"You had planned out, saw the ?"
"You, I'm a dreamer, too"
Lost the ? but I'll be right ?
And I'll take care of you
If you get knocked off your feet
I'll try to see it coming
I'll get a symphony to play that song ? love?
"Pick you up, take your hand, stop your crying"
There's no chance you won't make it through
I'm looking out for you
Beneath those scared eyes
There's something wonderful
That you don't know you have
I know you're scared but I'd pass up a miracle
Just to hear you laugh
"If you get tired of me, I'll pretend to let you go"
"If you need room to breathe, step back and watch you go"
"Sweet child, you've seen better days"
But you know it's gonna be okay
Show me that smile you got from your father
"It's gonna be fine just because you got my love, you got my love"
It's strange to think
The songs we used to sing
"The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone"
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong
"You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance"
"It was a moment of weakness and you said ""yes"""
"You should've said no, you should've gone home"
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should have known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
"You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me"
You can see that I've been crying
"Baby, you know all the right things to say"
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
"You say that the past is the past, you need one chance"
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
"You should've said no, you should've gone home"
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no baby and you might still have me
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth this?
Was she worth this?
"No, no, no, no, no, no"
"You should've said no, you should've gone home"
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word 'bout what you did with her'd get back to me
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no baby and you might still have me
"Paul There's no big fancy introduction, I don't think we really need one. We just start talking."
"Taylor I mean, yeah, we could do that."
"We could do that, right?"
"Yeah. I mean, did you have a fancy introduction planned?"
No?
Did you have a song prepared?
"Do we really, well, funny you should mention - no, no song. No song prepared, that's not gonna -"
Not at all? And I came all the way to Canada.
"Focusing on the year 1989, it was a great year. Do you know what the Best Picture that year was?"
I do not.
The movie that won Best Picture in 1989 Rain Man.
Amazing!
"Good movie, right?"
Fantastic.
"Good movie. The Album of the Year, do you know the ? that won a Grammy? It's the first time that this has happened, really, to you?"
Yeah.
In an interview about an album called 1989?
"Well, I just figured you'd just want to show off your knowledge."
"Well, it's the internet, it's not really showing off."
Okay.
George Michael's Faith!
Amazing!
Album of the Year.
This is actually educational.
"It's pretty good, right? But I was happy that it wasn't, like, there weren't too sketchy things. Those were really good things that stand up. Rain Man is still great to watch, Faith is still a fantastic album."
"Like a Prayer by Madonna came out in 1989, one of the most influential pop songs and music videos of all time."
You were born.
I was in 1989 for two weeks.
"Yeah, that's okay. That's okay."
But it still happened in that year.
"It happened in 1989. You've only released a studio album four times previous to this, so this is something that doesn't happen to you all that often. So, the title of it -"
It's really important.
"The theme of it is really important, right? When was the moment you decided it was gonna be 1989?"
"Actually, no one... this is why I like talking to you, because no one has ever come at it from this angle and actually asked me that specific question. It's actually a really interesting moment. I remember exactly when I decided that I was gonna call it 1989. It was the night of the Grammys this year. After the Grammys I didn't go to any afterparties or anything, I kind of wanted to go home and eat In-N-Out Burger with my friends. I remember going home and playing a lot of the new music I had recorded for some of my backup singers and one of my best friends. We were all sitting in the kitchen and I was playing them all this music, and they were just saying, ‘you know, this is very eighties. It’s very clear to us that this is so eighties.’ We were just talking and talking about how it’s kind of a rebirth in a new genre, how that’s a big bold step, how, kind of, starting a part of your career over. When they left that night, I just had this very clear moment of, ‘it’s gotta be called 1989. It's gotta be called that. We're talking about creative rebirth, my birth year, the album is eighties-influenced.' I didn't know I was doing that but I was doing that."
You didn't know you were doing that?
"I didn't mean to do it, I just was doing it. And so, then, after that, I really was able to focus on the, kind of, eighties sonic concept. And then it really came together as a very sonically cohesive project."
"Were you still writing songs in the traditional way, with a guitar?"
"Yes and no, I mean, some of them I wrote on piano, some of them I wrote on guitar. Some of them I would think of some synth line in my head and sing it into my phone and send it to my co-writers and say, ‘do you think this would sound cool?’"
"Like, without words, just singing the, kind of, synth line?"
"Yeah! Or singing a drum beat over top of it, and I would send it to them and I'd go, ‘I don’t have the right keyboard to make this sound in my house. I just have a piano and a guitar, but let me play it for you on piano and let you know what I think the bassline should be, and we can start there.’ Or it would be a first line of a first , or it would be, sort of, an image that I wanted to create a feeling around. We would just start with this image I had, or a story. It was a lot different than making any of my other albums."
It was?
Yeah.
Biggest difference was what?
"The biggest difference was that I didn't have any, I didn't have any boundaries around me production-wise. You know, one of my favorite things about country music is that it taught me how to tell stories. Coming up in the Nashville songwriting community was the greatest thing that could've ever happened to me because it taught me how to weave a story together with very, um, very detailed, personal details but also some, kind of, like, poetic, purple imagery. I love, kind of, I love how it all came about with my career, but at this point, it felt like I wanted to go and run in a direction that I had never run in before, which was, ""I wanna be able to use whatever instruments I want, whatever drum sounds I want, whatever vocal stylings I want. I want to build and layer things, and I don't want someone to say, 'well, this isn't country.'"" You know? And for me to be trying to prove that it was. So the reason this felt like a much more free experience was because I was able to write songs without the worry people would say it wasn't in the genre it was supposed to be in. So in labelling it pop and just calling it what it was, you know, when you make a pop album nobody's gonna look at it and say, ""well, that's not pop."" So I didn't have any restraints on me."
"Jason Aldean recently said something about how you're not gonna hear him writing a song about being a Wall Street stock broker because he doesn't even know where Wall Street's at, and that was the -"
He's gotta know where that is.
I think he-
It's in New York.
That's where he keeps his money.
He's gotta know. He knows where it's at.
"I think he was trying to say, just why -"
"I get what he's trying to say, though. Sorry, I was just, like, my dad is a stock broker who would've just been, like, his brain would be, like, *brain exploding gestures.*"
"I understand that that's his life and talking about, ""this is where I grew up, what I grew up knowing."" What you grew up knowing is much different. It's international."
Yeah.
It's the world. You've been traveling the world for a long time.
"I completely understand what he was saying there, because, I mean, with me, it's the same thing. It's like, as my life has changed, I need to continue to write about it, and I need to continue to write about even the things that change, like moving to New York and, you know, focusing more on my girlfriends rather than boyfriends. Like, these are things that are, kind of, the focal point of this new album. And as much of when I was in high school, I would sing about what my life was, which was, you know, sneaking out at night, and driving in trucks with your first boyfriend, and falling in love, and that, kind of, innocent summer romance thing, small towns, dirt roads. That was actually my life in high school. It's not anymore. So if I were to continue to write songs about that, I feel like it would be very disingenuous, and as a songwriter, that's the exact opposite of the goal I'm trying to accomplish."
"In listening to the songs I've heard already, they're still, they're very much story songs. You tell a story in each one. There's a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that's something that you focus on."
"Definitely. I mean, I think that's kind of engrained in me, and that's the one part of my songwriting that I don't think should change as everything else does. I think that my fans have gotten used to receiving my diary entries every two years, and getting that album and going, ""oh, this is what she's been through the last two years."""
"I meet a bunch of people who are in the public eye, but not quite like, there's nobody in the public eye like you. There's a few on the planet, and there's nothing that could prepare you for that. Am I right? There's nothing in life that could prepare you for that."
"I feel really lucky because I don't feel like I was shot out of a cannon, you know? A lot of people have their first single come out and it is everywhere, and all of a sudden they have a triple-platinum single, and there's all this anticipation about their album and then, all of a sudden, people start to tear them down, and it all happens over the course of six months to a year. My career build, I mean, we're going on, it's about nine years now since I put out my first album?"
"The record label was signed in 2005, right? The record deal rather, sorry."
"We're going on almost ten years, so it's been a really, really gradual arc, and that doesn't mean that sometimes it doesn't feel that it's at a crazy fever pitch that no one could ever prepare you for, but as much as you could possibly be prepared for it, I feel like time has kind of prepared me for it. I mean, some days I wake up and am absolutely overwhelmed by how abnormal my life is. It's not normal to have security with you wherever you go. It's not normal to have assistants. It's not normal to have hair and makeup every day. It's not normal -"
To give you people heat for holding a cat a certain way on the streets of New York.
That cat loves being held like that!
"I know! No, I know! But you can't do anything without somebody at some point on some website, ""well, the cat doesn't, this isn't right for the cat to be out like that."""
"The cat loves it. The cat, here's the thing -"
Is that Olivia?
"Yeah, that's Olivia. Yeah, you're right, exactly. And when everything that you do is debated upon, scrutinized, questioned, everybody feels entitled to ask you why you did everything. There are days where I feel really, really okay with that, honestly, but then there are days where I just, am kind of overwhelmed by all of it, and I think that that's okay. I try to encourage my fans that they don't have to feel confident every day, they don't have to feel happy every day, they don't have to feel pretty every day, they don't have to wanted every day. That they shouldn't put added, extra pressure on themselves to feel happy when they're not, you know? I think being honest with yourself emotionally is really important."
"When you signed that record deal in 2005, is there any advice you would go back and give to that girl that was signing that day? Or because the slow and gradual build it kind of worked out? I mean, it's obviously all worked out okay. What advice are you gonna give to somebody like that?"
"I don't think I'd wanna give her too much advice, I would... oh, I think I would tell her to laugh more. Just, you know, if you laugh at yourself first it's less funny when other people make fun of you. I would also explain to her the actual definition of feminism, because I didn't know it when I was younger. I think those are two important things for girls to know, going into this business or going into life itself. But all the other things, all the really intense, times I felt serious pain or rejection or humiliation or embarrassment, those have all produced the songs I'm the most proud of. There was this crazy circumstance that happened where I wrote this song ""Mean"" about the harshest criticisms I've ever gotten. It was brutal. And that song ended up winning two Grammys."
"Spectacular, yeah. In hindsight you don't ?, but if you knew something was coming, if someone said to you, ""there's something coming around the corner, it's brutal, you're gonna want to, you know, hoodie for three weeks, you're never gonna want to deal with it. But the result will be Album of the Year."""
"Oh my God, you'd do anything for that!"
"Fair enough. Like I said earlier, this is one of the things you don't get to do all the time. You get to go on stage a lot, you get to be interviewed a lot, all of these things happen to you, but album releases don't happen a lot."
They don't.
They don't happen a lot.
I'm really soaking it in.
Yeah? Do you still get as excited? I know you were saying you're more proud of this than any of them.
"Yeah. I'm so excited, I mean, honestly. Because having spent the last year and a half, just kind of living my life on my own terms and not, not dating, not focusing on really anything else other than figuring out the album I wanted to make, there's such an incentive for me, like, I'm so proud of it. And I've always been proud of my albums, but there's something about this one, where I feel like I actually did something different this time. I actually made something that is cohesive and fits together and has its own sound and something I was so focused on. And I can be focused on my fans, and I can, you know, like, I'm not tired right now during this interview. Like, I'm not distracted, I'm just, kind of, I'm just, really taking it in."
"The highs that you get on stage, almost nobody gets to experience, what you experience on stage. Which, again on the planet. You have one of those jobs that's very rare. What's second to that? What's the thing that comes the closest to the electricity that you feel when you're on stage?"
"I would say it's different all the time, but right now it's, like, seasonal stuff. Like, I get as excited about being on stage as I get about cozy things. Because just the idea of seasons changing. This is the time of year where I'm so out-of-control excited about the fact that it's fall. Guess what's next? Winter."
"Yes, so you're gonna have a hard time getting anybody here excited about that."
"It's two seasons that I love, and I can bake stuff all the time, and then I can give it to people. I can try out new recipes, I can wear sweaters, I can wear knee socks. I could even buy sweaters for my cats to wear."
Okay.
"I could do any of that, because it's that kind of season!"
But that's almost as exciting as being on stage in front of forty thousand people?
"You have to understand that if you're choosing your first place as being something like, ""ahhhhhhh,"" the second place has to be something that evens that out, which is, like, baking day with your friends."
"But your answer really is, ""I don't need another high like that, because that's the one I get by going on stage."""
I think that is actually my revised answer.
"You mentioned feminism. You have, almost by happy accident, become a real icon for girls and women, and you said earlier that that would be one of the things you might make sure you would change if you were to go back and talk to younger you, is to, kind of, narrow down that definition, or define the definition of feminism. Do you realize, kind of, how great that it is for young girls to see what you're doing? I mean, you get to experience that ?, right? When you talk to parents of young girls, right?"
"That's awesome. It's interesting because I think that feminism is such an important conversation to be having. Especially right now, because with girls out there in the world living their lives, knowing what it means is so important, because all it means is that they feel they should be treated exactly the same way as guys. They should be given equal opportunities and rights. And I think the more people like Lena Dunham talk about it, like, Lorde and Emma Watson talk about it, and the fact that it's becoming, sort of, a conversation that is top-of-mind in the media. I think it's so incredible. I've always made music so I could feel camaraderie with my fans, not in a way that was trying to cater to, kind of, any male fantasy, and that wasn't on purpose, that's just been what has felt natural to me. When asked early on about feminism in my career, I just, I think I was probably fifteen the first time I was asked about it. And so I would just say, ""I don't talk about politics, I don't really understand that stuff yet, so I guess I'm just gonna say I'm not."" And I wish that when I was younger I would've known that it's simply hoping for gender equality."
Probably not so fair of the interviewer to ask a fifteen-year-old about that.
"You know, that's an interesting point to make. But I think that, in the media, it's very interesting to witness, on a daily basis. You know, you go online, and we all see these gossip blogs every single time we log on, because we're curious and that's the society we live in. But you'll see these polls, like, ""vote on who has a better butt! This woman or this woman?"" And you never see ""who has a better butt this man or this man?"" It just never happens. ""Who's the hotter mama this woman or this woman?"" It's not, like, ""who's the sexiest dad this man or this man?"" You just don't see it. And people are allowed to pit women against each other and vote, and they think it's an innocent thing, when really it's kind of warping your mind that, you know. And if a young girl logs on and votes, it's like she's going, ""oh my God, if that girl in my class is pretty and smart, then maybe everyone's comparing me to her, and maybe I should hate her."" And that's just, it's feeding this negativity and I really think that with girls, kind of, banding together, in music, in culture, in movies, whatever. I think it's nice to see people actually cheer each other on and girls be friends with each other, because hopefully that will kind of bleed into the classroom, and the playground, and the campus, and all that."
"I know it seems like disposable entertainment for adults, but it's not only adults who are seeing this stuff."
It's mostly not adults.
It's mostly not adults.
"It's mostly very impressionable kids and young girls who are still forming their ideas of who they actually are. And to warp their opinions of other girls, that just adds anxiety to their life that they don't need."
"This kind of brings me to talking about your legacy, and I know, I think five albums in it's appropriate to start talking a little bit about that. I'm guessing that you try very hard to make sure that the music you make, you release the things you take part in enough, that they'll all be able to stand up. Not just to the test of time, say, sonically or whatever, but that you can continue to be proud of this, is that right?"
"Yeah, it's completely right, it's dead-on. I've always had this thing where I think about what, if I'm lucky enough to have grandkids someday, what they would say. If they looked back on pictures, and videos, and things like that, and I'd sure they'd laugh at me and make fun of my awkwardness and things like that. But I would never want to embarrass them. It's interesting because it's like the whole role model question, like, are you a role model? Do you think about the little kids in the front row when you're doing all the things you're doing in this life? I think that's an unnecessary pressure to put on yourself, but it's easier when you make it about your own life, your own legacy, when you, kind of, bring it in house, and you're, like, ""what if I have a five-year-old someday? And what if someday my ten-year-old goes online for the first time? Like, what do I want her to see about me?"""
That's a pretty good way to look at it.
"It's something that happens very naturally where if you're, kind of, just taking accountability and responsibility for your own actions, it's kind of a natural thing that happens, where, you know, all of a sudden you have parents coming up and thanking you, and you're just, sort of, like, ""hm, well, you're welcome."" Where you were just, kind of, trying to live a good life, because I think, you know, you don't want to feel like you're the national president of the babysitters club, but you do wanna try to do good things, and make ripples, and good echoes in society, and culture, and all that."
"But you are doing that, and in the music that I've heard already, man, are people gonna get a kick out of hearing this, and experiencing it live. It's great, congratulations on this."
Good. Thank you!
It's epic. The album's out.
"Thank you! It's great to talk to you, as always."
"As always. Thanks, Taylor."
Awesome.
Nice job.
Thanks! You're so good!
"Thank you, thank you for doing this."
I always end up telling you stuff that I've never thought to say in interviews.
"Here's to the tour that taught me that your real friends really don't care about the ""he said/she said."" Here's to the moments when we've forgotten all about the things that scare us, the things we're insecure about, and in spite of them, we jumped around together under flashing lights, fireworks, and confetti."
"To the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in your worst times, they can see the best in you."
"Here's to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things they've sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well as they do. Here's to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Here's to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party."
"Here's to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes. Here's to life teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together. Everything I've learned about a ""reputation"" and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you, I've learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums."
"Thanks to you, I'm doing better than I ever was."
"Love,"
Taylor
There's a girl that you want
She’s everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it’s like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her
Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
"Store windows, traveled for miles"
But something I passed really caught my eye
"It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars"
But I fell in love with this here guitar
"Nice to meet you, can I teach you"
"All I know, can you show me what you do"
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar
"It was my baby, anyone could see"
"I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty"
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar
"Nice to meet you, can I teach you"
"All I know, can you show me what you do"
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar
Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone?
"Hey, did some primadonna love you"
'Til she got her fame and fortune?
I won't do that to you
"Nice to meet you, can I teach you"
"All I know, can you show me what you do"
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend?
This here guitar
You're my guitar
This here guitar
I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade
"Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you"
Somebody blows your candle out
"You wore a mask, now that's broken too"
Everybody else was everything to you
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade
I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
"You've seen the world, now all you see is me"
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fade
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It would've been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you
Would've been cool to never fall down
But then I never would've seen
The power isn't with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
"I'm saying one, saying one, saying one for you"
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
 - Shortened
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you
Just had a conversation with the mirror
I ended up not having much to say
"Said ""Today is for the lovers and the leaders"
"I hate to tell you, it just ain't your day"""
So this is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
And it's a complication with the voices
Rounding all around inside my mind
I used to think this heart had lots of choices
But they all lead to your doorstep every time
This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
So this is my apology
"My words, my tears, are all me"
Laid out in front of you
Like a grasp for truth
On a Sunday afternoon
This is a song for you
This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
And you'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
Ooh
I still love you
I had a conversation with the mirror
It ended up not having much to say

Stay Stay Stay
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
"I threw my phone across the room, at you"
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I've read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
"And said ""okay, let's talk"""
And I said
"Stay, stay, stay"
"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time"
"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
"Stay, stay, stay"
"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time"
"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
So I think that it's best if we both stay
"Stay, stay, stay"
You took the time to memorize me
"My fears, my hopes, and dreams"
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
Ho Hey
"Ho, hey, ho, hey"
So show your family
All the blood that I would bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart 
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you 
You belong with me 
"So please, please"
Stay Stay Stay
"Stay, stay, stay"
I'll be loving you for quite some time
"No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad"
"So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay"
"Stay, stay, stay"
"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time"
"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
"So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay"
"Stay, stay, stay"
"I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time"
"You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad"
So I think that it's best if we both stay
"Any day now, they're talking war"
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
"Oh, daddy can I go with you?"
"Oh, daddy can I go with you?"
"You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall"
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're going to be
"You say, this crazy world's come undone"
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't going to take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today
Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two
Outro
"Oh, daddy can I go with you?"
"Oh, daddy can I go with you?"
"Oh, daddy can I go with you?"
"When the sun shine, we shine together"
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
"Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end"
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
"(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)"
Under my umbrella
"(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)"
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
I may be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
"Baby, ‘cause in the dark"
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because
"When the sun shine, we'll shine together"
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
"Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end"
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
"(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)"
Under my umbrella
"(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)"

Verso 1
"Por favor, me imagine nas árvores"
Eu atingi meu pico aos sete
Pés no balanço sobre o riacho
Eu tinha medo demais para pular
"Mas eu, eu estava alto no céu"
Com a Pennsylvania sobre mim
Ainda há coisas belas?
Refrão
Doce chá no verão
"Jure de coração, não contará para mais ninguém"
E mesmo que não consiga lembrar de seu rosto
Eu ainda tenho amor por você
Suas tranças como um padrão
Te amo até a Lua e até Saturno
Passado adiante como canções folclóricas
O amor dura tanto
E eu queria te contar
Acho que sua casa é assombrada
Seu pai está sempre bravo e deve ser por isso
E eu acho que você devia vir morar comigo
E podemos ser piratas
Aí você não vai precisar chorar
Ou se esconder no armário
E assim como as canções folclóricas
Nosso amor passará adiante
Ponte
"Por favor, me imagine nas ervas"
Antes de eu aprender civilidade
Eu gritava ferozmente
Qualquer hora que quisesse
"Eu, eu"
Refrão
Doce chá no verão
"Juro de coração, não contarei para mais ninguém"
E mesmo que não consiga lembrar de seu rosto
Eu ainda tenho amor por você
Traga suas bonecas e um suéter
"Nos mudaremos para a Índia, para sempre"
Passado adiante como canções folclóricas
Nosso amor dura tanto

 1 Clean
The drought was the very worst
"Oh-oh, oh-oh"
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
"Oh-oh, oh-oh"
Pre-Chorus Clean
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
 Clean
Rain came pouring down
"When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe"
And by morning
"Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean"
I think I am finally clean
 1 Long Live
"I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind"
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
 Long Live
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
"One day, we will be remembered"
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
"One day, we will be remembered"
Bridge Long Live
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Transition New Year's Day
And hold on...
To spinning around...
Confetti...
Falls to the ground...
 1 New Year's Day
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
"You and me from the night before, but"
 New Year's Day
Don't read the last page
"But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared"
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
 2 New Year's Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
"I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe"
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
 New Year's Day
Don't read the last page
"But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong"
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
Your face jumped right in my way
As things lately do
Oh baby can't you see
The thought of you makes a mess of me
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
And Now I
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you
"Oh, ah"
I get lost when I drive around town
Thinkin' 'bout your smile
Always ending' up
Your side of town
And I don't know why
Must be somethin' under this hood
Nobody's strong like you
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you
Your eyes are the color of
The great big sea
The one I go swimmin' in
Every time you look at me
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'Bout you
Outro
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinking' bout' you
I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy
I want a love that's sweeter than roses
And for me this is how it's gonna be
Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet
Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
I'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
It's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect
Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And he music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet
I want my own little storybook ending
We'll make it up as we go
There's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet
I want love they haven't thought of yet

"Letra de ""Taylor Swift - mirrorball (Tradução em Português)"""
Verso 1
Eu quero que você saiba
Eu sou uma bola de espelhos
Eu te mostrarei cada versão de você essa noite
Eu vou te colocar na pista
Brilhando lindamente
"E quando eu quebro, é em um milhão de pedaços"
Refrão
"Quieto, quando não há ninguém por perto, meu querido"
Você me encontrará nas minhas mais altas pontas dos pés
"Girando nos meus saltos mais altos, amor"
Brilhando só para você
"Quieto, eu sei que dizem que o fim está próximo"
Mas eu ainda estou nas minhas mais altas pontas dos pés
"Girando nos meus saltos mais altos, amor"
Brilhando só para você
Verso 2
Eu quero que você saiba
Eu sou uma bola de espelhos
Eu posso mudar cada parte de mim para me encaixar
Você não é como os regulares
Os foliões mascarados
Bêbados em quanto assistem meus estilhaços cintilarem
Refrão
"Quieto, quando não há ninguém por perto, meu querido"
Você me encontrará nas minhas mais altas pontas dos pés
"Girando nos meus saltos mais altos, amor"
Brilhando só para você
"Quieto, eu sei que dizem que o fim está próximo"
Mas eu ainda estou nas minhas mais altas pontas dos pés
"Girando nos meus saltos mais altos, amor"
Brilhando só para você
Ponte
"E eles cancelaram o circo, queimaram a discoteca"
Quando mandaram pra casa os cavalos e palhaços de rodeio
Eu ainda estou naquela corda bamba
Eu ainda estou tentando de tudo pra te fazer rir de mim
"Eu ainda acredito, mas não sei o porquê"
"Eu nunca fui natural, tudo que eu faço é tentar, tentar, tentar"
Eu ainda estou naquele trapézio
Eu ainda estou tentando de tudo pra te manter olhando pra mim
Saída
Porque eu sou uma bola de espelhos
Eu sou uma bola de espelhos
Eu te mostrarei cada versão de você essa noite
 1 You're Not Sorry
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around
 You're Not Sorry
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
"But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before"
"You're not sorry, no, no"
 2 You're Not Sorry
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you didn't leave me waiting in the cold
You've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before
 You're Not Sorry
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
"But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before"
"You're not sorry, no"
"You're not sorry, no"
Bridge You're Not Sorry
"You had me crawling for you, honey"
"And it never would've gone away, no"
"You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade"
Pre-Chorus What Goes Around.../...Comes Around
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
I'm so confused about it 
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
"Won't you tell me, is this fair?"
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you go around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
"But that's okay, baby"
'Cause in time you will find
 What Goes Around.../...Comes Around
"What goes around, goes around"
"Comes around, comes all the way back around"
"What goes around, goes around"
"Comes around, comes all the way back around"
"What goes around, goes around"
"Comes around, comes all the way back around"
"What goes around, goes around"
"Comes around, comes all the way back around "
"What goes around, goes around"
"Comes around, comes all the way back around"
"What goes around, goes around "
"Comes around, comes all the way back around"
"What goes around, goes around"
"Comes around, comes all the way back around"
"What goes around, goes around"
"Comes around, comes all the way back around"
 You're Not Sorry
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
"But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before"
"You're not sorry, no, no"
"No, no, no, no, no"
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no"
Outro What Goes Around.../...Comes Around (Bridge)
You spend your nights alone
And she never comes home
"And when you call her up, all you get's a busy tone"
"And she's doing to you, what you did to me"
A tale as old as time
"Boy, you got what you deserved"
Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home
Let me close my eyes for a second
"See if I can get out of here, and"
"Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun"
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
"But I don't, I just sit under this tree"
And I'm in Tennessee
Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
"Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond"
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze
Let me close my eyes for a second
"See if I can stay right here, and"
"Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun"
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
"But I don't, I just sit under this tree"
And I'm in Tennessee
When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
"I need to go back, back to where I feel so free"
"Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee"
"I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun"
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
"But I don't, I just sit under this tree"
Just me and Eloise
And I'm in Tennessee
Journal Snippet
I’m getting older and less sure of what you like about me anyway
How can a person know everything at 18 and nothing at 22
And will you still want me when I’m nothing new?
We were both young when I first saw you
"I close my eyes, and the flashback starts"
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
See you make your way through the crowd
"And say, ""hello"""
Little did I know
Pre-Chorus 1
"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
"And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet"""
And I was crying on the staircase
"Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said"
1
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
"We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew"
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Pre-Chorus 2
"'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter"
"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said
2
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
"Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel"
"This love is difficult, but it's real"
"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess"
"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
"Oh, oh"
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
"When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said"
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
"And said ""Marry me Juliet"
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
"I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress"
"It's a love story baby just say 'yes'"""

To songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next
In the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet?
Tim McGraw
I Have heard this song
DJ
Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it?
Or how was the first time?
Tim
It was awesome. Uh except for I didn't know if I should I should take it
As a compliment or I should feel old
DJ
A ha ha ha
Tim
I didn't know which one but the more
The more I hear it the more...I don't know if its true or not
But I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old
I don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think
DJ
Why don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?
Taylor
Oh its definitely a compliment. Yeah
(Laughing)
DJ
Tim McGraw meet Taylor Swift
Tim
Nice-
Taylor
Nice to meet you
Tim
"Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?"
Taylor
I'm doing great. How are you doing?
Tim
I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great
Taylor
Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good
Music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker
(laughing)
DJ
Well-
Taylor
The funny thing about this song is ya know
As a writer some of the songs that you write like  hours you'll
Do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but
I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really
Didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so
I kinda shelved it for like  months and never even thought that it
Was going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like
We're putting that out
(laughing)
Tim
Well I'm glad ya did cuz um it's doing well for ya
DJ
So I-
So I understand that you two guys have not talked
Tim
No
DJ
You haven't met
Tim
No
Taylor
"No, we've never talked or met or anything"
Tim
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly
Or something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was
I was doing an interview and they were going to interview
"Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message"
"So, I don't know if she got it or not"
Taylor
Oh my God. They never gave that to me
Tim
"They didn't? Ok well, there ya go. I did"
(laughing)
DJ
So I-I
Taylor
We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything
Tim
Not at all
DJ
"So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called"
Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?
Taylor
It was definitely kind of a chance
Ya know I did say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking
"Ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad"
Tim
"Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad"
I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-
Taylor
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?
Tim
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way
Taylor
"Oh my gosh, she's awesome"
Tim
I agree
DJ
"This, this...Tell me about writing a song"
"Um did this, did this really happen?"
Taylor
"Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing"
Session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw
"Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um..."
(laughing)
Taylor
I actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the
Melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year
Of high school
Tim
Now I feel old
Taylor
And um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself
And I was going through a period where I was dating this guy
That was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up
So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind
Him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya
Know that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are
Tim
"Aww, thank you"
Taylor
"And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first"
And so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano
And wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering
If I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know
The funny thing is that I shelved this song for like  months and
"Never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it"
"And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it"
"For my record label president and he goes ""well thats your first single"""
(laughing)
Taylor
And I'm like well
Tim
"Well you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor"
(laughing)
Taylor
Thats awesome. There's a part two coming out next month
Tim
"Alright, great"
(laughing)
Tim
Well congratulations cuz its your first single

And I know you're off to the races here
You're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you
Taylor
"Awesome, its been so exciting"
"Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?"
Tim
Um I dont know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that
(laughing)
Taylor
"Well I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it"
Tim
Ya do? What would-
Taylor
Yeah
Tim

Taylor
"Uh, um I think Taylor something"

DJ
"Ah, well thats very good. You're pretty fearless Taylor Swift"

Tim

Taylor
Bye
Tim
Good luck out there
Taylor
Thanks
Lyrics from Taylor's Inner Circle
A heart is drawn around your name
"In someone's handwriting, not mine"
"I would be complex, I would be cool"
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man"
I'd be the man
I'd be the man
"They'd say I hustled, put in the work"
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
"What I was wearing, or if I was rude"
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
"And they would toast to me, oh"
Let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man"
I'd be the man
"I'd be the man, yeah"
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
It's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
"I'd be a bitch, not a baller"
They'd paint me out to be bad
"So, it's okay that I'm mad"
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
You know that I'm so sick of them coming at me again
"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man"
"I'd be the man, yeah"
"Yeah, I'd be the man, yeah"
"Oh, I'd be the man"
I'd be the man
Outro
If I was a man
Then I'd be the man

"My favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story. They do more than just set the scene or paint the picture. The writing I love the most places you into that story, that room, that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your heart race as the character's does. It’s something F. Scott Fitzgerald did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment."
"I'm highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. I'm clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house. When I hear ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"" by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics. When I hear ""How to Save a Life"" by The Fray, ""Breathe (2AM)"" by Anna Nalick, or ""The Story"" by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When I'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room – just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Grey's Anatomy soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). I'm convinced that ""You Learn"" by Alanis Morissette, ""Put Your Records On"" by Corinne Bailey Rae and ""Why"" by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs."
"I love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when I'm writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever."
"The fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. You'd think that as pop writers, we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic… AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See ""Love Story,"" 2009)."
"In modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like ""Kiki, do you love me"" and ""Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover"" have been breaking through on the most global cultural level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana."
"I think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, ""this is what I went through"" as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. It's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book."
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
"And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends"
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
"And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name"
"And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away"
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
"Windows flung right open, autumn air"
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
"Back when we were card sharks, playing games"
I thought you were leading me on
"I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street"
Before you even knew I was gone
"But then you called, showed your hand"
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
"Sat on the roof, you and I"
"I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends"
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
"And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name"
"And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away"
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'll never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
"Years ago, we were just inside"
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
"That became my religion, listen"
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
"Oh, never again"
"‘Cause baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name"
"And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away"
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you
Outro
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
Lembrei desse sentimento
Gritando dentro de nós
Éramos todos meninos
Em cada um vivia uma paixão
Como uma cena de um filme
Vencemos pesadelos enfrentando os dragões
Criados por nossos medos
Fruto da imaginação
De frente a uma nova era
Na onda de uma canção
Nós construímos a história
"Mente, alma e coração"
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
De frente a uma nova era
Na onda de uma canção
Nós construímos a história
"Mente, alma e coração"
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Lembrei do momento
Que fiz promessa pra nós dois
Pintando o nosso destino
"Puro e simples, pleno e sem fim"
Que fosse assim sem um goodbye
Fosse para sempre um cheguei
Os sonhos que construímos
"Me vi feliz, eu te achei"
Será muito mais que achar
Será muito além de pensar
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live
All the magic we made
"And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid"
Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long long live the look and your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
"Letra de ""Taylor Swift - this is me trying (Tradução em Português)"""
Verso 1
Ando com dificuldade de me ajustar
"Eu tinha as rodas mais brilhantes, agora elas enferrujam"
Eu não sabia se você se importaria se eu voltasse
Eu tenho muitos arrependimentos sobre isso
Parei o carro na estrada para o mirante
Poderia ter seguido meus medos ladeira à baixo
E talvez eu não saiba bem o que dizer
Mas estou aqui na sua porta
Refrão
Eu só quero que você saiba que essa sou eu tentando
Eu só quero que você saiba que essa sou eu tentando
Verso 2
Me disseram que todas as minhas prisões eram psicológicas
"Então me desperdicei, como todo meu potencial"
E minhas palavras atiram para matar quando estou brava
Eu tenho muitos arrependimentos sobre isso
"Eu estava tão em frente à curva, que a curva virou uma esfera"
Fiquei para trás de todos os meus colegas de classe e acabei aqui
Despejando meu coração para um estranho
Mas não despejei o whiskey
Refrão
Eu só quero que você saiba que essa sou eu tentando
Eu só quero que você saiba que essa sou eu tentando
Pós-Refrão
Pelo menos estou tentando
Ponte
E é difícil estar numa festa quando me sinto uma ferida aberta
É difícil estar em qualquer lugar nesses dias em que tudo que eu quero é você
Você é um flashback em um rolo de filme na única tela da minha cidade
Refrão
Eu só quero que você saiba que essa sou eu tentando
(E talvez eu não saiba bem o que dizer)
Eu só quero que você saiba que essa sou eu tentando
Saída
Pelo menos estou tentando
"Letra de ""Taylor Swift - the last great american dinasty (Tradução em Português)"""
Verso 1
"Rebekah andou no trem da tarde, estava ensolarado"
Sua casa saltbox na praia tirou sua cabeça de St. Louis
Bill era o herdeiro do dinheiro e nome da companhia de petróleo Standard
"E a cidade disse, ""Como uma divorciada de classe média conseguiu?"""
"O casamento foi encantador, mas um pouco gauche"
Novo dinheiro só vai até certo ponto
"Eles escolheram uma casa e chamaram-na de ""Holiday House"""
"Suas festas eram de bom gosto, mas um pouco altas"
O médico falou para ele se acalmar
Deve ter sido culpa dela que seu coração falhou
E eles disseram
Refrão
Lá se vai a última grande dinastia americana
"Quem sabe, se ela nunca aparecesse, o que aconteceria"
Lá vai a mulher mais louca que essa cidade já viu
Ela se divertiu muito estragando tudo
Verso 2
Rebekah desistiu da cena de Rhode Island para sempre
Trouxe todas as suas amigas vadias da cidade
Encheu a piscina de champanhe e nadou com os grandes nomes
E gastou todo o dinheiro com os garotos e o balé
E perdendo apostas de jogos de cartas com Salvador Dalí
E eles disseram
Refrão
Lá se vai a última grande dinastia americana
"Quem sabe, se ela nunca aparecesse, o que aconteceria"
Lá vai a mulher mais sem-vergonha que essa cidade já viu
Ela se divertiu muito estragando tudo
Ponte
Dizem que ela era ocasionalmente vista
"Andando nas pedras, olhando para o mar à meia-noite"
E brigando com o vizinho
Ela roubou o cachorro dele e tingiu de verde-limão
Cinquenta anos é muito tempo
Holiday House ficou quieta naquela praia
"Livre de mulheres loucas, e homens com seus hábitos"
E aí foi comprada por mim
Refrão
"Quem sabe, se eu nunca aparecesse, o que aconteceria"
Lá vai a mulher mais barulhenta que essa cidade já viu
Eu me diverti muito estragando tudo
Saída
Eu me diverti muito estragando tudo
Diverti muito estragando tudo
Diverti muito
Eu me diverti muito

There you are
Standin' there like you don’t know what to say
And I move like this
"Here I am, racing myself, I wanna know what's coming now, what a waste"
(Pre-Chorus)
"Well all of that time, I thought you were mine"
Was I just kidding myself?
"For letting it go, and loving you so, don't you dare tell me not to look at you like that"
(Chorus)
"Gonna look at you like that, I’m gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that"
-2
"Won't you say, that we can still be friends"
It doesn't work that way
"And don't you dare think, that a pack of all my tears can take that"
Crying out when I'm alone
(Pre-Chorus)
"Doing right here, I'm crying right now, you can watch me crumble down, that’s for breaking my heart, so baby don’t stop, thinking you could ask me not to look at you like, that"
(Chorus)
"Gonna look at you like that, I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it’s the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that"
(Bridge)
"Don't you tell me to be strong, and make it harder than it has to be, after you don't call, and remember what you’ve done to me"
(Chorus)
"Cause I'm gonna look at you like that, gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, after what you put me through, I'm gonna have to let you know,???"
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
Gonna look at you like that
"Look at you, Look at you, Look at you, like that"
"Nah nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah.."
I remember the eyes
Of the kid in the crowd
Who cut me down to size
Realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage
There's a kid in the crowd

"Letra de ""Taylor Swift - august (Tradução em Português)"""
Verso 1
"Ar salgado, e a ferrugem na sua porta"
Eu nunca precisei de mais nada
"Sussurros de ""Você tem certeza?"""
Eu nunca fiz isso antes
Refrão
"Mas posso nos ver, perdidos na memória"
Agosto se perdeu num momento no tempo
Porque nunca foi meu
"E eu posso nos ver, enrolados nos lençóis"
Agosto acabou como uma garrafa de vinho
Porque você nunca foi meu
Verso 2
Suas costas sob o sol
Querendo escrever meu nome nelas
Você vai ligar quando voltar para a escola?
Eu lembro de pensar que tinha você
Refrão
"Mas posso nos ver, perdidos na memória"
Agosto se perdeu num momento no tempo
Porque nunca foi meu
"E eu posso nos ver, enrolados nos lençóis"
Agosto acabou como uma garrafa de vinho
Porque você nunca foi meu
Na época em que ainda estávamos mudando para o melhor
Querer era o suficiente
"Pra mim, era suficiente"
Viver pela esperança disso tudo
Cancelei planos só caso você ligasse
"E dissesse ""Me encontre atrás do shopping"""
"Grande coisa, amor de verão e dizer ""nós"""
Porque você não era meu para perder
"Você não era meu para perder, não"
Refrão
"Mas posso nos ver, perdidos na memória"
Agosto se perdeu num momento no tempo
Porque nunca foi meu
"E eu posso nos ver, enrolados nos lençóis"
Agosto acabou como uma garrafa de vinho
Porque você nunca foi meu
Saída
Porque você nunca foi meu
Nunca foi
Mas você se lembra?
"Lembra quando eu parei e disse ""Suba no carro"""
E então cancelei meus planos só caso você ligasse?
Na época em que eu vivia pela esperança disso tudo
Me encontre atrás do shopping
"(Lembra quando eu parei e disse ""Suba no carro"")"
(E então cancelei meus planos só caso você ligasse?)
(Na época em que eu vivia pela esperança disso tudo)
"(""Me encontre atrás do shopping"")"
"Lembra quando eu parei e disse ""Suba no carro"""
E então cancelei meus planos só caso você ligasse?
Na época em que eu vivia pela esperança disso tudo (Pela esperança disso tudo)
"Pela esperança disso tudo, pela esperança disso tudo"
"(Pela esperança disso tudo, pela esperança disso tudo)"

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
"I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye"
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
So I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
"Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke"
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
"It's brighter now, now"
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
And I can still see it all in my mind
"All of you, all of me intertwined"
I once believed love would be black and white
But it's golden golden
And I can still see it all in my head
"Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed"
I once believed love would be burning red
But it's golden
"Like daylight, like daylight"
"Like daylight, like daylight"
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
Outro
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
"Just let it go, let it go"
You turn your dial to 9.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed
Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say
You should turn Z9 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
"I sing a song called ""Tim McGraw"""
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard
Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growing up not wearing any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day
Growing up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Because she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ
So you should turn Z9 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
"I sing a song called ""Tim McGraw"""
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
"Get drunk, but it's not enough"
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
"I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home"
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
"They say, ""I don't know"""
And what once was ours is no one's now
"I see you everywhere, the only thing we share"
Is this small town
"You said it was a great love, one for the ages"
"So  if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?"
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
"Get drunk, but it's not enough"
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts
"My heart, my hips, my body, my love"
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
"Our songs, our films, united we stand"
"Our country, guess it was a lawless land"
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
"My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust"
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
"Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough"
"But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts"
"Get drunk, but it's not enough"
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
"No, it's not"
It's death by a thousand cuts
Part of me that you didn't touch
"My body, my love, my trust"
"But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no"
Outro
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
"They say, ""I don't know"""
"1. ""...Ready For It?"""
"2. ""Gorgeous"""
". ""Look What You Made Me Do"""
". ""Delicate"" (Acoustic)"
"5. ""Blank Space"""
"6. ""Shake It Off"""

Intro
I promise that you'll never find another like me
"I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh"
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I'm a psycho on the phone
Never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
"Baby doll, when it comes to a lover"
I promise that you'll never find another like
"Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
I'm the only one of me
"Baby, that's the fun of me"
"Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
You're the only one of you
"Baby, that's the fun of you"
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
"But I will never bore you, baby"
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
Never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
"Livin' in winter, I am your summer"
"Baby doll, when it comes to a lover"
I promise that you'll never find another like
"Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
"Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
You're the only one of you
"Baby, that's the fun of you"
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
Hey kids (Spelling is fun)
"Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"""
"But you know there is a ""me"""
"Strike the band up, 1, 2, "
I promise that you'll never find another like me
"Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"""
"But you know there is a ""me"""
"And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me"""
I promise that you'll never find another like
"Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
I'm the only one of me
"Baby, that's the fun of me"
"Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
You're the only one of you
"Baby, that's the fun of you"
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
Outro
"Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)"
"But you know there is a ""me"""
I'm the only one of me

"Strike the band up, 1, 2,  (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)"
"You can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me"""
You're the only one of you
"Baby, that's the fun of you"
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
"This is our place, we make the rules"
"And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear"
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
"Forever and ever, ah"
"Take me out, take me home"
"You're my, my, my, my lover"
We could let our friends crash in the living room
"This is our place, we make the call"
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
"I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all"
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
"Forever and ever, ah"
"Take me out, take me home (Forever and ever)"
"You're my, my, my, my lover"
"Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?"
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
"And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover"
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
"Forever and ever, ah"
"Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)"
"You're my, my, my, my"
"Oh, you're my, my, my, my"
"Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
The Man
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
"'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man"
"I'd be the man, I'd be the man yeah"
"Cause I'd be the man, I'd be the man"
Love Story
We were both young when I first saw you
"I close my eyes, and the flashback starts"
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
See you make your way through the crowd
"And say, ""hello"""
Little did I know
"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
"And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet"""
And I was crying on the staircase
"Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said"
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
"It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""
I Knew You Were Trouble
"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago"
"I was in your sights, you got me alone"
"You found me, you found me, you found me"
"I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that"
"And when I fell hard, you took a step back"
"Without me, without me, without me"
"And he's long gone, when he's next to me"
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
"So, shame on me now"
Flew me to places I'd never been
"'Til you put me down, oh"
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
"So, shame on me now"
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
"Oh, oh-oh (yeah)"
"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
"Oh, oh-oh (yeah)"
"Trouble, trouble"
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
"Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!"
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
"So, shame on me now"
Flew me to places I'd never been
"'Til you put me down, oh"
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
"(Knew it right there, knew it right there)"
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
Blank Space
"Nice to meet you, where you been?"
I could show you incredible things
"Magic, madness, heaven, sin"
"Saw you there, and I thought"
"Oh my God, look at that face	6	2019-11-2
58	Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius	AMAs Artist of the Decade Performance 	You look like my next mistake	6	2019-11-2
58	Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius	AMAs Artist of the Decade Performance 	Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy
"New money, suit and tie"
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
"So hey, let's be friends"
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
"You can tell me when it's over, mm"
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
"It'll leave you breathless, hmm"
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
"But I've got a blank space, baby"
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
"Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya"
Boys only want love if it's torture
"Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya"
Shake It Off
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
"That's what people say, mm, mm"
"That's what people say, mm, mm"
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
"At least that's what people say, mm, mm"
"That's what people say, mm, mm"
But I keep cruisin'
"Can't stop, won't stop movin'"
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright
"'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play"
"And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate"
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
"I Shake it off, I shake it off"
"Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break"
"And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake"
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
"I Shake it off, I shake it off"
"Hey, hey, hey"
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
"And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world"
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
"She's like, ""Oh my God,"" but I'm just gonna shake"
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
"Why don't you come on over, baby?"
"We can shake, shake, shake"
"Yeah, oh, oh, oh"
"'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play"
"And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate"
(Haters gonna hate)
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
"I Shake it off, I shake it off"
"Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break"
"And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake"
"Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake"
"I Shake it off, I shake it off"
"I Shake it off, I shake it off"
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
"I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"
Lover
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
"This is our place, we make the rules"
"And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear"
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

"Forever and ever, ah"
"Ah, take me out, and take me home"

"THE PALM TREES ARRIVED IN FEBRUARY, seven in all, set against a pastel blue backdrop with superimposed stars. It appeared that a new Taylor Swift era was upon us — that the old happy-go-lucky Taylor was not, in fact, dead. Or did it? It was only an Instagram photo, just one more picture in an infinite content scroll. But it also came from a pop star known for prodigious hint-dropping, whose fans turn every piece of info into an online archaeological dig."
"As expected, the summery post sent Swifties sifting through each detail with a fine-tooth comb. What did the trees symbolize? An overdue vacation? A recently purchased beach house? A secret palm-frond collection? Or maybe, as many surmised, it was new music. One Twitter user predicted that the number of stars in the background of the photo hinted at a single drop “There’s about 60/61 stars️. There’s 61 days until April 26, FRIDAY, a SINGLE RELEASE day!” Another said it was the unofficial announcement of her next LP “Okay so in this picture there are  palm trees on the left ( country albums). There are two palm trees on the right (2 pop albums). There is one large palm tree in the middle. This represents her new album.” These may sound like ludicrous conspiracy theories — for the record, they were mostly correct — but they fit firmly within the Taylor Swift Musical Uni (it’s like the Marvel Cinematic Uni but with more guitars and fewer Stan Lee cameos)."
"“I posted that the day that I finished the seventh album,” says Swift about the photo. “I couldn’t expect my fans to know that. I figured they’d figure it out later, but a lot of their theories were actually correct. Those Easter eggs were just trying to establish that tone, which I foreshadowed ages ago in a Spotify vertical video for ‘Delicate’ by painting my nails those pastel colors.”"
"It’s now April, and the 29-year-old pop star is in a Los Angeles photo studio, giving her first sit-down magazine interview in three years. She wants to discuss the art of placing hints inside her work, as well as the upcoming record, which she recorded as soon as she finished the Reputation Tour. She’s also keen on detailing her own obsessions, talking up the TV shows, books, and songs that help shape her outlook on life."
"Over the past 1 years, Swift has perfected the pop culture feedback loop She shares updates about her life and drops hints about new music, which fans then gobble up and re-promote with their own theories, which Swift then re-shares on her Tumblr or incorporates into future clues. It’s like a T-Swift-built Escher staircase of personal memories and moments that tease what’s next. “I’ve trained them to be that way,” she says of her fans’ astute detective work. Swift is a pop culture fanatic herself (see the jean jacket she’s wearing on the EW cover) and has an innate understanding of the lengths her audience will go to be a part of the original creation. “I love that they like the cryptic hint-dropping. Because as long as they like it, I’ll keep doing it. It’s fun. It feels mischievous and playful.”"
"Through this approach, Swift has designed the ultimate artistic scavenger hunt — and it’s easy to get swept up in its drama, even if you don’t listen to her music. Her moments aren’t always hidden, either. Sometimes Swift highlights aspects of her world just so fans feel like they’re on the journey with her. Like the time in March 2018 when pop singer Hayley Kiyoko was accused of shading Swift after mentioning her name during an interview. On Tumblr, Swift re-shared a fan’s post, adding commentary that defended Kiyoko, which immediately dispelled any conflicts between the two artists; Swift’s post subsequently received more than 29,000 notes. Four months later, she invited Kiyoko on stage during the Reputation Tour to sing her hit “Curious.” Kiyoko returned the favor when she had Swift join her that December at a benefit on behalf of the LGBTQ organization the Ally Coalition to perform “Delicate.” Fans of both artists were elated by the mutual support."
"The feedback loop also extends outside of music. In October 2018, Swift broke her silence about politics by publicly endorsing two candidates for office in her adopted state of Tennessee, while encouraging her followers to register to vote. She kept up the civic momentum through Election Day when she asked fans to post selfies after voting; Swift then eagerly re-promoted her favorites on Instagram stories."
"This practice of sharing and re-sharing and sharing again is why listeners consider Swift one of the world’s most accessible pop stars, someone willing to not only interact with her audience but invite them to secret listening sessions, or make the occasional surprise visit to their wedding or prom. It’s a symbiotic relationship, one that, as Swift tells EW, helped her dig out of the darker era of reputation. “It’s definitely the fans that made that tonal shift in the way I was feeling,” she says. “Songwriters need to communicate, and part of communicating correctly is when you put out a message that is understood the way you meant it. reputation was interesting because I’d never before had an album that wasn’t fully understood until it was seen live. When it first came out everyone thought it was just going to be angry; upon listening to the whole thing they realized it’s actually about love and friendship, and finding out what your priorities are.”"
"Then, during the Reputation Tour, she had an epiphany that despite the caricature that she thought had been created of her, there were many people who saw what others had simply refused to. “I would look out into the audience and I’d see these amazing, thoughtful, caring, wonderful, empathetic people,” she says. “So often with our takedown culture, talking s— about a celebrity is basically the same as talking s— about the new iPhone. So when I go and I meet fans, I see that they actually see me as a flesh-and-blood human being. That — as contrived as it may sound — changed me completely, assigning humanity to my life.”"
"At tour’s end, she channeled that positive energy into the studio, recording the new album in just under three months. But the fast pace won’t mean a short LP. Swift confirmed that her seventh record (she hasn’t announced a title yet; the working nickname among fans is TS7) will include more songs than any of her previous releases. “I try not to go into making an album with any expectation,” she says. “I started to write so much that I knew immediately it would probably be bigger.”"
"The project will also feature a mix of old and new collaborators (on the candy-coated lead single “ME!” Swift brought in Panic! At the Disco frontman Brendon Urie and coproducer Joel Little, both of whom she had never worked with), but she is unsurprisingly coy about doling out much more information, as if doing so would break the carefully honed T-Swiftian feedback loop. “There’s a lot of a lot on this album,” she says. “I’m trying to convey an emotional spectrum. I definitely don’t wanna have too much of one thing…. You get some joyful songs and you get the bops, as they say.” There’s also, she adds, some “really, really, really, really sad songs,” but “not enough to where you need to worry about me.”"
"She gives us one more clue The true distinction between TS7 and reputation is in the delivery. “This time around I feel more comfortable being brave enough to be vulnerable, because my fans are brave enough to be vulnerable with me. Once people delve into the album, it’ll become pretty clear that that’s more of the fingerprint of this — that it’s much more of a singer-songwriter, personal journey than the last one.”"
"The past month has seen a deluge of Swift activity, from the release of the new single to dropping more hints in interviews about the record and its title, which is apparently hidden somewhere inside the “ME!” music video (current fan guesses include Kaleidoscope and Daisy). But if the Easter eggs from the pop star seem like a business-as-usual routine, she says this album does indeed mark a new era of her life, where she’s been better able to prioritize what’s important to her."
"“Our priorities can get messed up existing in a society that puts a currency on curating the way people see your life,” she says. “Social media has given people a way to express their art. I use it to connect with fans. But on the downside you feel like there are  trillion new invisible hoops that you have to jump through, and you feel like you’ll never be able to jump through them all correctly. I — along with a lot of my friends and fans — am trying to figure out how to navigate living my life and not just curating what I want people to think living my life is. I’m not always able to maintain a balance, and I think that’s important for everyone to know about. We’re always learning, and that’s something that I also had to learn — that I’ve got to be brave enough to learn. Learning in public is so humiliating sometimes…. Do I feel more balanced in my life than I ever have before? Um, probably yeah. But is that permanent? No. And I think being okay with that has put me in a bit of a better position.” Strong words to live by, to quote, to re-share, to tweet back to her, and see if she’ll respond."
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
Pre-Chorus 1
"I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about"
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
Pre-Chorus 2
"He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right"
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
"I keep singing, don't know why I do..."
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
"And there he goes, so perfectly"
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Pre-Chorus 
"She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love"
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
"I keep singing, don't know why I do..."
"So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light"
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
"I keep singing, don't know why I do..."
Outro
"He's the time taken up, but there's never enough"
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
"Combat, I'm ready for combat"
"I say I don't want that, but what if I do?"
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
"Easy they come, easy they go"
"I jump from the train, I ride off alone"
"I never grew up, it's getting so old"
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
"Who could ever leave me, darling"
But who could stay?
"Dark side, I search for your dark side"
"But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?"
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
"I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost"
"The room is on fire, invisible smoke"
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
"Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling"
But who could stay?
"(I see right through me, I see right through me)"
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
"All the king's horses, all the king's men"
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
"Who could ever leave me, darling"
But who could stay?
"(I see right through me, I see right through me)"
But who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You
Outro
"Combat, I'm ready for combat"
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
"And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM"
"Say it in the street, that's a knock-out"
"But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out"
"And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?"""
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
"So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)"
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
"So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)"
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparin' all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
You need to calm down
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)"
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down
Outro
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down
Intro
"This one's called ""Picture to Burn"""
"One, two, three"
"Well, state the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy"
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
"That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay"
And by the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
"As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn"
"Well, there's no time for tears"
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
"As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn"
"And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself"
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
"You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying"
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
"As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn"
Outro
"Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn"
You're just another picture to burn
"Baby, burn"
Thank you so much!
Thank you!
