Lover,Lover ,[Verse 1]
Lover,Lover ,We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
Lover,Lover ,"And this is our place, we make the rules"
Lover,Lover ,"And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear"
Lover,Lover ,Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Lover,Lover ,[Chorus]
Lover,Lover ,Can I go where you go?
Lover,Lover ,Can we always be this close?
Lover,Lover ,"Forever and ever, ah"
Lover,Lover ,"Take me out, and take me home"
Lover,Lover ,"You're my, my, my, my lover"
Lover,Lover ,[Verse 2]
Lover,Lover ,We could let our friends crash in the living room
Lover,Lover ,"This is our place, we make the call"
Lover,Lover ,And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Lover,Lover ,"I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all"
Lover,Lover ,[Chorus]
Lover,Lover ,Can I go where you go?
Lover,Lover ,Can we always be this close?

Lover,Lover ,"You're my, my, my, my lover"
Lover,Lover ,[Bridge]
Lover,Lover ,"Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?"
Lover,Lover ,With every guitar string scar on my hand
Lover,Lover ,I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Lover,Lover ,My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
Lover,Lover ,All's well that ends well to end up with you
Lover,Lover ,Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
Lover,Lover ,And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
Lover,Lover ,"And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover"
Lover,Lover ,[Chorus]
Lover,Lover ,Can I go where you go?
Lover,Lover ,Can we always be this close?

reputation,Reputation [Prologue] ,Here's something I've learned about people.
reputation,Reputation [Prologue] ,"We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip."
reputation,Reputation [Prologue] ,"This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you."
reputation,Reputation [Prologue] ,"The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'."
reputation,Reputation [Prologue] ,"When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?"
reputation,Reputation [Prologue] ,"Let me say it again, louder for those in the back..."
reputation,Reputation [Prologue] ,"We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us."
reputation,Reputation [Prologue] ,There will be no further explanation.
reputation,Reputation [Prologue] ,There will be just reputation.

Speak Now (Deluxe),Mine ,[Pre-Chorus 2]

Red,Holy Ground ,Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Red,Holy Ground ,"Took off faster than a green light, go"
Red,Holy Ground ,"Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know"
Red,Holy Ground ,I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
Red,Holy Ground ,And that was the first day
Red,Holy Ground ,[Chorus]
Red,Holy Ground ,"And darling, it was good"
Red,Holy Ground ,Never looking down
Red,Holy Ground ,And right there where we stood
Red,Holy Ground ,Was holy ground
Red,Holy Ground ,[Verse 2]
Red,Holy Ground ,Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
Red,Holy Ground ,We had this big wide city all to ourselves
Red,Holy Ground ,"We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you"""
Red,Holy Ground ,"And for the first time, I had something to lose"
Red,Holy Ground ,And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
Red,Holy Ground ,And the story's got dust on every page
Red,Holy Ground ,"But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now"
Red,Holy Ground ,And I see your face in every crowd
Red,Holy Ground ,[Chorus]
Red,Holy Ground ,"'Cause darling, it was good"
Red,Holy Ground ,Never looking down
Red,Holy Ground ,And right there where we stood
Red,Holy Ground ,Was holy ground

Speak Now (Deluxe),Better Than Revenge ,She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
Speak Now (Deluxe),Better Than Revenge ,I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
Speak Now (Deluxe),Better Than Revenge ,And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
Speak Now (Deluxe),Better Than Revenge ,[Pre-Chorus 2]
Speak Now (Deluxe),Better Than Revenge ,But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Speak Now (Deluxe),Better Than Revenge ,Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Speak Now (Deluxe),Better Than Revenge ,"Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Better Than Revenge ,But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again, but I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him, it was losing me."

1989 (Deluxe),I Know Places (Voice Memo) ,"So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together"
1989 (Deluxe),I Know Places (Voice Memo) ,"I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places"". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song"

1989 (Deluxe),Blank Space (Voice Memo) ,"So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called ""Blank Space,"" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the ""Oh!"" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called ""Blank Space."""

1989 (Deluxe),1989 [Liner Notes] ,"Prologue""These songs were once about my life. They are now about yours."""
1989 (Deluxe),1989 [Liner Notes] ,"I was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1989."
1989 (Deluxe),1989 [Liner Notes] ,"In the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn..."
1989 (Deluxe),1989 [Liner Notes] ,The debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new?
1989 (Deluxe),1989 [Liner Notes] ,"For the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before."
1989 (Deluxe),1989 [Liner Notes] ,"I wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no ""riding off into the sunset,"" like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind. I've learned how to shake things off."
1989 (Deluxe),1989 [Liner Notes] ,"I've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive."
1989 (Deluxe),1989 [Liner Notes] ,"I hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for."
1989 (Deluxe),1989 [Liner Notes] ,From the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love...

Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,Prologue
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,"'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens."
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,"Real life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything."
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,"I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help."
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,"These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world."
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,"Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone."
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,"What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest."
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,"So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’"
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,"There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it."
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.
Speak Now (Deluxe),Speak Now [Liner Notes] ,"Love, Taylor"

1989 (Deluxe),I Wish You Would (Voice Memo) ,"This is another way I've written songs recently. This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me"". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that"". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:"
1989 (Deluxe),I Wish You Would (Voice Memo) ,"Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this"

1989 (Deluxe),I Wish You Would (Voice Memo) ,Cause you still don't know what I never said
1989 (Deluxe),I Wish You Would (Voice Memo) ,I wish you would come back
1989 (Deluxe),I Wish You Would (Voice Memo) ,Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
1989 (Deluxe),I Wish You Would (Voice Memo) ,I wish you knew that
1989 (Deluxe),I Wish You Would (Voice Memo) ,"I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I"
1989 (Deluxe),I Wish You Would (Voice Memo) ,"Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good"

Fearless,Fearless [Liner Notes] ,Taylor's Letter
Fearless,Fearless [Liner Notes] ,"This album is called ""Fearless"", and I guess I'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, ""Fearless"" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you'e tried before, you've lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can't breathe without them. I think it's fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say ""you're NOT sorry"", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless"

Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"According to my birth certificate, I turn 30 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. I've heard people say that your thirties are ""the most fun!"" So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned before reaching 30, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 1
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren’t, how you’re failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I’m showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I’m training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. I’m also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to “go die in a hole ho” while I’m having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it’s healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 2
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life’s worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 3
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, it’s good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It’s especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That’s GOOD. We’ll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That’s not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you’ll learn from it. Then you’ll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it’s fine; do you, you’re searching."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 4
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 5
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn’t cruel. It’s just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 6
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I’ve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren’t allowed to age. It’s an impossible standard to meet, and I’ve been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we’re supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn’t even remotely required of men."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 7
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I’ve ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I’ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 8
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was “couples goals” based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn’t real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 9
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm’s cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 10
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I’ve always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I’ll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten’s Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawson’s Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver’s Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what I’m pretty sure the internet would call a “weird flex.”)"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 11
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I’d hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 12
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it’s so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say “I’m sorry, but...” and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 13
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"It’s my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying “This happened to me.” It’s something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don’t."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 14
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you’ve never dealt with before, it’s okay to say that you don’t know what to say. Sometimes just saying you’re so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It’s okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don’t have all the answers. However, it’s not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they’re at their lowest point. Even if you can’t really help the situation, it’s nice for them to know that you would if you could."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 15
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 16
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don’t know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn’t gold, and first impressions actually aren’t everything. It’s impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a “solid first 15”), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they’ve seen you broken? Or after they’ve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they’re people? These are things a first impression could never convey."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 17
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can’t I be soft during all the seasons?!"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 18
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It’s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 19
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you’re shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 20
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about “we’re in our young twenties!” hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they’ll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It’s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you’ll always keep the memories."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 21
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don’t look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you’re doing it wrong. See: Bleachella."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 22
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you’re not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren’t trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there’s a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who “won” the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say “Hey, same team.” Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don’t give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 23
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don’t care if I’m #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they’re here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I’ll never forget the ones who stuck around."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 24
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I’ve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It’s taught me that there are real problems and then there’s everything else. My mom’s cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 25
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I remember people asking me, “What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?” There’s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I’m really grateful to have learned this isn’t true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 26
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I make countdowns for things I’m excited about. When I’ve gone through dark, low times, I’ve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (they’re free) and adding things I’m looking forward to. Even if they’re not big holidays or anything, it’s good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it’s good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 27
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I learned that disarming someone’s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I’ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I’ve ever felt in my life, but I can’t tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It’s the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll’s hateful Instagram comment with “lol.” It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I’ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 28
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I’m finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I’m going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 29
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It’s the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they’ve left me. Please pray for their safe return."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,Lesson 30
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 ,"My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I’d lock myself in my room and couldn’t forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I’ve made a mistake, whether it’s self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I’ve come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go."

Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,I'm shaking my head and locking the gates
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,[Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,"This is why we can't have nice things, darling"

Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,I had to take them away
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,"This is why we can't have nice things, honey"

Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,And therein lies the issue
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,Friends don't try to trick you

Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,And so I took an axe to a mended fence
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,[Pre-Chorus: TIWWCHNT]
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together/This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things ,But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately

Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Yeah.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),In an interview about an album called 1989?
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Well, I just figured you'd just want to show off your knowledge."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Well, it's the internet, it's not really showing off."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Okay.

Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"It's pretty good, right? But I was happy that it wasn't, like, there weren't too sketchy things.

Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Like a Prayer by Madonna came out in 1989, one of the most influential pop songs and music videos of all time."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),You were born.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),I was in 1989 for two weeks.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Yeah, that's okay. That's okay."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),But it still happened in that year.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"It happened in 1989. You've only released a studio album four times previous to this, so this is something that doesn't happen to you all that often. So, the title of it -"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),It's really important.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"The theme of it is really important, right? When was the moment you decided it was gonna be 1989?"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Actually, no one... this is why I like talking to you, because no one has ever come at it from this angle and actually asked me that specific question. It's actually a really interesting moment. I remember exactly when I decided that I was gonna call it 1989. It was the night of the Grammys this year. After the Grammys I didn't go to any afterparties or anything, I kind of wanted to go home and eat In-N-Out Burger with my friends. I remember going home and playing a lot of the new music I had recorded for some of my backup singers and one of my best friends. We were all sitting in the kitchen and I was playing them all this music, and they were just saying, ‘you know, this is very eighties. It’s very clear to us that this is so eighties.’ We were just talking and talking about how it’s kind of a rebirth in a new genre, how that’s a big bold step, how, kind of, starting a part of your career over. When they left that night, I just had this very clear moment of, ‘it’s gotta be called 1989. It's gotta be called that. We're talking about creative rebirth, my birth year, the album is eighties-influenced.' I didn't know I was doing that but I was doing that."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),You didn't know you were doing that?
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I didn't mean to do it, I just was doing it. And so, then, after that, I really was able to focus on the, kind of, eighties sonic concept. And then it really came together as a very sonically cohesive project."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Were you still writing songs in the traditional way, with a guitar?"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Yes and no, I mean, some of them I wrote on piano, some of them I wrote on guitar. Some of them I would think of some synth line in my head and sing it into my phone and send it to my co-writers and say, ‘do you think this would sound cool?’"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Like, without words, just singing the, kind of, synth line?"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Yeah! Or singing a drum beat over top of it, and I would send it to them and I'd go, ‘I don’t have the right keyboard to make this sound in my house. I just have a piano and a guitar, but let me play it for you on piano and let you know what I think the bassline should be, and we can start there.’ Or it would be a first line of a first verse, or it would be, sort of, an image that I wanted to create a feeling around. We would just start with this image I had, or a story. It was a lot different than making any of my other albums."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),It was?
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Yeah.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Biggest difference was what?
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"The biggest difference was that I didn't have any, I didn't have any boundaries around me production-wise. You know, one of my favorite things about country music is that it taught me how to tell stories. Coming up in the Nashville songwriting community was the greatest thing that could've ever happened to me because it taught me how to weave a story together with very, um, very detailed, personal details but also some, kind of, like, poetic, purple imagery. I love, kind of, I love how it all came about with my career, but at this point, it felt like I wanted to go and run in a direction that I had never run in before, which was, ""I wanna be able to use whatever instruments I want, whatever drum sounds I want, whatever vocal stylings I want. I want to build and layer things, and I don't want someone to say, 'well, this isn't country.'"" You know? And for me to be trying to prove that it was. So the reason this felt like a much more free experience was because I was able to write songs without the worry people would say it wasn't in the genre it was supposed to be in. So in labelling it pop and just calling it what it was, you know, when you make a pop album nobody's gonna look at it and say, ""well, that's not pop."" So I didn't have any restraints on me."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Jason Aldean recently said something about how you're not gonna hear him writing a song about being a Wall Street stock broker because he doesn't even know where Wall Street's at, and that was the -"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),He's gotta know where that is.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),I think he-
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),It's in New York.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),That's where he keeps his money.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),He's gotta know. He knows where it's at.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I think he was trying to say, just why -"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I get what he's trying to say, though. Sorry, I was just, like, my dad is a stock broker who would've just been, like, his brain would be, like, [*brain exploding gestures.*]"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I understand that that's his life and talking about, ""this is where I grew up, what I grew up knowing."" What you grew up knowing is much different. It's international."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Yeah.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),It's the world. You've been traveling the world for a long time.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I completely understand what he was saying there, because, I mean, with me, it's the same thing. It's like, as my life has changed, I need to continue to write about it, and I need to continue to write about even the things that change, like moving to New York and, you know, focusing more on my girlfriends rather than boyfriends. Like, these are things that are, kind of, the focal point of this new album. And as much of when I was in high school, I would sing about what my life was, which was, you know, sneaking out at night, and driving in trucks with your first boyfriend, and falling in love, and that, kind of, innocent summer romance thing, small towns, dirt roads. That was actually my life in high school. It's not anymore. So if I were to continue to write songs about that, I feel like it would be very disingenuous, and as a songwriter, that's the exact opposite of the goal I'm trying to accomplish."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"In listening to the songs I've heard already, they're still, they're very much story songs. You tell a story in each one. There's a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that's something that you focus on."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Definitely. I mean, I think that's kind of engrained in me, and that's the one part of my songwriting that I don't think should change as everything else does. I think that my fans have gotten used to receiving my diary entries every two years, and getting that album and going, ""oh, this is what she's been through the last two years."""
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I meet a bunch of people who are in the public eye, but not quite like, there's nobody in the public eye like you. There's a few on the planet, and there's nothing that could prepare you for that. Am I right? There's nothing in life that could prepare you for that."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I feel really lucky because I don't feel like I was shot out of a cannon, you know? A lot of people have their first single come out and it is everywhere, and all of a sudden they have a triple-platinum single, and there's all this anticipation about their album and then, all of a sudden, people start to tear them down, and it all happens over the course of six months to a year. My career build, I mean, we're going on, it's about nine years now since I put out my first album?"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"The record label was signed in 2005, right? The record deal rather, sorry."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"We're going on almost ten years, so it's been a really, really gradual arc, and that doesn't mean that sometimes it doesn't feel that it's at a crazy fever pitch that no one could ever prepare you for, but as much as you could possibly be prepared for it, I feel like time has kind of prepared me for it. I mean, some days I wake up and am absolutely overwhelmed by how abnormal my life is. It's not normal to have security with you wherever you go. It's not normal to have assistants. It's not normal to have hair and makeup every day. It's not normal -"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),To give you people heat for holding a cat a certain way on the streets of New York.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),That cat loves being held like that!
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I know! No, I know! But you can't do anything without somebody at some point on some website, ""well, the cat doesn't, this isn't right for the cat to be out like that."""
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"The cat loves it. The cat, here's the thing -"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Is that Olivia?
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Yeah, that's Olivia. Yeah, you're right, exactly. And when everything that you do is debated upon, scrutinized, questioned, everybody feels entitled to ask you why you did everything. There are days where I feel really, really okay with that, honestly, but then there are days where I just, am kind of overwhelmed by all of it, and I think that that's okay. I try to encourage my fans that they don't have to feel confident every day, they don't have to feel happy every day, they don't have to feel pretty every day, they don't have to wanted every day. That they shouldn't put added, extra pressure on themselves to feel happy when they're not, you know? I think being honest with yourself emotionally is really important."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"When you signed that record deal in 2005, is there any advice you would go back and give to that girl that was signing that day? Or because the slow and gradual build it kind of worked out? I mean, it's obviously all worked out okay. What advice are you gonna give to somebody like that?"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I don't think I'd wanna give her too much advice, I would... oh, I think I would tell her to laugh more. Just, you know, if you laugh at yourself first it's less funny when other people make fun of you. I would also explain to her the actual definition of feminism, because I didn't know it when I was younger. I think those are two important things for girls to know, going into this business or going into life itself. But all the other things, all the really intense, times I felt serious pain or rejection or humiliation or embarrassment, those have all produced the songs I'm the most proud of. There was this crazy circumstance that happened where I wrote this song ""Mean"" about the harshest criticisms I've ever gotten. It was brutal. And that song ended up winning two Grammys."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Spectacular, yeah. In hindsight you don't [?], but if you knew something was coming, if someone said to you, ""there's something coming around the corner, it's brutal, you're gonna want to, you know, hoodie for three weeks, you're never gonna want to deal with it. But the result will be Album of the Year."""
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Oh my God, you'd do anything for that!"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Fair enough. Like I said earlier, this is one of the things you don't get to do all the time. You get to go on stage a lot, you get to be interviewed a lot, all of these things happen to you, but album releases don't happen a lot."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),They don't.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),They don't happen a lot.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),I'm really soaking it in.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Yeah? Do you still get as excited? I know you were saying you're more proud of this than any of them.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Yeah. I'm so excited, I mean, honestly. Because having spent the last year and a half, just kind of living my life on my own terms and not, not dating, not focusing on really anything else other than figuring out the album I wanted to make, there's such an incentive for me, like, I'm so proud of it. And I've always been proud of my albums, but there's something about this one, where I feel like I actually did something different this time. I actually made something that is cohesive and fits together and has its own sound and something I was so focused on. And I can be focused on my fans, and I can, you know, like, I'm not tired right now during this interview. Like, I'm not distracted, I'm just, kind of, I'm just, really taking it in."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"The highs that you get on stage, almost nobody gets to experience, what you experience on stage. Which, again on the planet. You have one of those jobs that's very rare. What's second to that? What's the thing that comes the closest to the electricity that you feel when you're on stage?"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I would say it's different all the time, but right now it's, like, seasonal stuff. Like, I get as excited about being on stage as I get about cozy things. Because just the idea of seasons changing. This is the time of year where I'm so out-of-control excited about the fact that it's fall. Guess what's next? Winter."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Yes, so you're gonna have a hard time getting anybody here excited about that."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"It's two seasons that I love, and I can bake stuff all the time, and then I can give it to people. I can try out new recipes, I can wear sweaters, I can wear knee socks. I could even buy sweaters for my cats to wear."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Okay.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I could do any of that, because it's that kind of season!"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),But that's almost as exciting as being on stage in front of forty thousand people?
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"You have to understand that if you're choosing your first place as being something like, ""ahhhhhhh,"" the second place has to be something that evens that out, which is, like, baking day with your friends."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"But your answer really is, ""I don't need another high like that, because that's the one I get by going on stage."""
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),I think that is actually my revised answer.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"You mentioned feminism. You have, almost by happy accident, become a real icon for girls and women, and you said earlier that that would be one of the things you might make sure you would change if you were to go back and talk to younger you, is to, kind of, narrow down that definition, or define the definition of feminism. Do you realize, kind of, how great that it is for young girls to see what you're doing? I mean, you get to experience that [?], right? When you talk to parents of young girls, right?"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"That's awesome. It's interesting because I think that feminism is such an important conversation to be having. Especially right now, because with girls out there in the world living their lives, knowing what it means is so important, because all it means is that they feel they should be treated exactly the same way as guys. They should be given equal opportunities and rights. And I think the more people like Lena [Dunham] talk about it, like, Lorde and Emma Watson talk about it, and the fact that it's becoming, sort of, a conversation that is top-of-mind in the media. I think it's so incredible. I've always made music so I could feel camaraderie with my fans, not in a way that was trying to cater to, kind of, any male fantasy, and that wasn't on purpose, that's just been what has felt natural to me. When asked early on about feminism in my career, I just, I think I was probably fifteen the first time I was asked about it. And so I would just say, ""I don't talk about politics, I don't really understand that stuff yet, so I guess I'm just gonna say I'm not."" And I wish that when I was younger I would've known that it's simply hoping for gender equality."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Probably not so fair of the interviewer to ask a fifteen-year-old about that.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"You know, that's an interesting point to make. But I think that, in the media, it's very interesting to witness, on a daily basis. You know, you go online, and we all see these gossip blogs every single time we log on, because we're curious and that's the society we live in. But you'll see these polls, like, ""vote on who has a better butt! This woman or this woman?"" And you never see ""who has a better butt: this man or this man?"" It just never happens. ""Who's the hotter mama: this woman or this woman?"" It's not, like, ""who's the sexiest dad: this man or this man?"" You just don't see it. And people are allowed to pit women against each other and vote, and they think it's an innocent thing, when really it's kind of warping your mind that, you know. And if a young girl logs on and votes, it's like she's going, ""oh my God, if that girl in my class is pretty and smart, then maybe everyone's comparing me to her, and maybe I should hate her."" And that's just, it's feeding this negativity and I really think that with girls, kind of, banding together, in music, in culture, in movies, whatever. I think it's nice to see people actually cheer each other on and girls be friends with each other, because hopefully that will kind of bleed into the classroom, and the playground, and the campus, and all that."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"I know it seems like disposable entertainment for adults, but it's not only adults who are seeing this stuff."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),It's mostly not adults.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),It's mostly not adults.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"It's mostly very impressionable kids and young girls who are still forming their ideas of who they actually are. And to warp their opinions of other girls, that just adds anxiety to their life that they don't need."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"This kind of brings me to talking about your legacy, and I know, I think five albums in it's appropriate to start talking a little bit about that. I'm guessing that you try very hard to make sure that the music you make, you release the things you take part in enough, that they'll all be able to stand up. Not just to the test of time, say, sonically or whatever, but that you can continue to be proud of this, is that right?"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Yeah, it's completely right, it's dead-on. I've always had this thing where I think about what, if I'm lucky enough to have grandkids someday, what they would say. If they looked back on pictures, and videos, and things like that, and I'd sure they'd laugh at me and make fun of my awkwardness and things like that. But I would never want to embarrass them. It's interesting because it's like the whole role model question, like, are you a role model? Do you think about the little kids in the front row when you're doing all the things you're doing in this life? I think that's an unnecessary pressure to put on yourself, but it's easier when you make it about your own life, your own legacy, when you, kind of, bring it in house, and you're, like, ""what if I have a five-year-old someday? And what if someday my ten-year-old goes online for the first time? Like, what do I want her to see about me?"""
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),That's a pretty good way to look at it.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"It's something that happens very naturally where if you're, kind of, just taking accountability and responsibility for your own actions, it's kind of a natural thing that happens, where, you know, all of a sudden you have parents coming up and thanking you, and you're just, sort of, like, ""hm, well, you're welcome."" Where you were just, kind of, trying to live a good life, because I think, you know, you don't want to feel like you're the national president of the babysitters club, but you do wanna try to do good things, and make ripples, and good echoes in society, and culture, and all that."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"But you are doing that, and in the music that I've heard already, man, are people gonna get a kick out of hearing this, and experiencing it live. It's great, congratulations on this."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Good. Thank you!
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),It's epic. The album's out.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Thank you! It's great to talk to you, as always."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"As always. Thanks, Taylor."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Awesome.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Nice job.
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),Thanks! You're so good!
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),"Thank you, thank you for doing this."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,1989 Interview with Paul McGuire  (Ft. Paul McGuire (CMT)),I always end up telling you stuff that I've never thought to say in interviews.
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,Reputation Tour Book Intro ,"Here's to the tour that taught me that your real friends really don't care about the ""he said/she said."" Here's to the moments when we've forgotten all about the things that scare us, the things we're insecure about, and in spite of them, we jumped around together under flashing lights, fireworks, and confetti."
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,Reputation Tour Book Intro ,"To the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in your worst times, they can see the best in you."
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,Reputation Tour Book Intro ,"Here's to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things they've sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well as they do. Here's to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Here's to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party."
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,Reputation Tour Book Intro ,"Here's to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes. Here's to life teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together. Everything I've learned about a ""reputation"" and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you, I've learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums."
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,Reputation Tour Book Intro ,"Thanks to you, I'm doing better than I ever was."
Taylor Swift  by Concert Genius,Reputation Tour Book Intro ,"Love,"

Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,The Power of Pop ,"My favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story. They do more than just set the scene or paint the picture. The writing I love the most places you into that story, that room, that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your heart race as the character's does. It’s something F. Scott Fitzgerald did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,The Power of Pop ,"I'm highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. I'm clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house. When I hear ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"" by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics. When I hear ""How to Save a Life"" by The Fray, ""Breathe (2AM)"" by Anna Nalick, or ""The Story"" by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When I'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room – just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Grey's Anatomy soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). I'm convinced that ""You Learn"" by Alanis Morissette, ""Put Your Records On"" by Corinne Bailey Rae and ""Why"" by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,The Power of Pop ,"I love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when I'm writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,The Power of Pop ,"The fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. You'd think that as pop writers, we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic… AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See ""Love Story,"" 2009)."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,The Power of Pop ,"In modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like ""Kiki, do you love me"" and ""Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover"" have been breaking through on the most global cultural level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,The Power of Pop ,"I think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, ""this is what I went through"" as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. It's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book."

Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,[Verse 1]
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,Everyone looked worse in the light
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,[Chorus]
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,But now I see daylight
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I only see daylight
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,[Verse 2]
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,So I became the butt of the joke
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"It's brighter now, now"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,[Chorus]
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,(I can never look away)

Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,(Things I'm never gonna say)
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,(Now I'm wide awake)
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,But now I see daylight
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I only see daylight
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,[Bridge]
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,And I can still see it all in my mind
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"All of you, all of me intertwined"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I once believed love would be black and white
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,But it's golden golden
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,And I can still see it all in my head
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I once believed love would be burning red
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,But it's golden
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"Like daylight, like daylight"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"Like daylight, like daylight"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,[Chorus]
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,(Now I'm wide awake)
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,But now I see daylight
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,I only see daylight
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight"
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,[Outro]
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Live from Paris,Daylight (Live from Paris) ,"Just let it go, let it go"

Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"THE PALM TREES ARRIVED IN FEBRUARY, seven in all, set against a pastel blue backdrop with superimposed stars. It appeared that a new Taylor Swift era was upon us — that the old happy-go-lucky Taylor was not, in fact, dead. Or did it? It was only an Instagram photo, just one more picture in an infinite content scroll. But it also came from a pop star known for prodigious hint-dropping, whose fans turn every piece of info into an online archaeological dig."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"As expected, the summery post sent Swifties sifting through each detail with a fine-tooth comb. What did the trees symbolize? An overdue vacation? A recently purchased beach house? A secret palm-frond collection? Or maybe, as many surmised, it was new music. One Twitter user predicted that the number of stars in the background of the photo hinted at a single drop: “There’s about 60/61 [stars]️. There’s 61 days until April 26, FRIDAY, a SINGLE RELEASE day!” Another said it was the unofficial announcement of her next LP: “Okay so in this picture there are 4 palm trees on the left (4 country albums). There are two palm trees on the right (2 pop albums). There is one large palm tree in the middle. This represents her new album.” These may sound like ludicrous conspiracy theories — for the record, they were mostly correct — but they fit firmly within the Taylor Swift Musical Universe (it’s like the Marvel Cinematic Universe but with more guitars and fewer Stan Lee cameos)."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"“I posted that the day that I finished the seventh album,” says Swift about the photo. “I couldn’t expect [my fans] to know that. I figured they’d figure it out later, but a lot of their theories were actually correct. Those Easter eggs were just trying to establish that tone, which I foreshadowed ages ago in a Spotify vertical video for ‘Delicate’ by painting my nails those [pastel] colors.”"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"It’s now April, and the 29-year-old pop star is in a Los Angeles photo studio, giving her first sit-down magazine interview in three years. She wants to discuss the art of placing hints inside her work, as well as the upcoming record, which she recorded as soon as she finished the Reputation Tour. She’s also keen on detailing her own obsessions, talking up the TV shows, books, and songs that help shape her outlook on life."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"Over the past 13 years, Swift has perfected the pop culture feedback loop: She shares updates about her life and drops hints about new music, which fans then gobble up and re-promote with their own theories, which Swift then re-shares on her Tumblr or incorporates into future clues. It’s like a T-Swift-built Escher staircase of personal memories and moments that tease what’s next. “I’ve trained them to be that way,” she says of her fans’ astute detective work. Swift is a pop culture fanatic herself (see: the jean jacket she’s wearing on the EW cover) and has an innate understanding of the lengths her audience will go to be a part of the original creation. “I love that they like the cryptic hint-dropping. Because as long as they like it, I’ll keep doing it. It’s fun. It feels mischievous and playful.”"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"Through this approach, Swift has designed the ultimate artistic scavenger hunt — and it’s easy to get swept up in its drama, even if you don’t listen to her music. Her moments aren’t always hidden, either. Sometimes Swift highlights aspects of her world just so fans feel like they’re on the journey with her. Like the time in March 2018 when pop singer Hayley Kiyoko was accused of shading Swift after mentioning her name during an interview. On Tumblr, Swift re-shared a fan’s post, adding commentary that defended Kiyoko, which immediately dispelled any conflicts between the two artists; Swift’s post subsequently received more than 29,000 notes. Four months later, she invited Kiyoko on stage during the Reputation Tour to sing her hit “Curious.” Kiyoko returned the favor when she had Swift join her that December at a benefit on behalf of the LGBTQ organization the Ally Coalition to perform “Delicate.” Fans of both artists were elated by the mutual support."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"The feedback loop also extends outside of music. In October 2018, Swift broke her silence about politics by publicly endorsing two candidates for office in her adopted state of Tennessee, while encouraging her followers to register to vote. She kept up the civic momentum through Election Day when she asked fans to post selfies after voting; Swift then eagerly re-promoted her favorites on Instagram stories."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"This practice of sharing and re-sharing and sharing again is why listeners consider Swift one of the world’s most accessible pop stars, someone willing to not only interact with her audience but invite them to secret listening sessions, or make the occasional surprise visit to their wedding or prom. It’s a symbiotic relationship, one that, as Swift tells EW, helped her dig out of the darker era of reputation. “It’s definitely the fans that made that tonal shift in the way I was feeling,” she says. “Songwriters need to communicate, and part of communicating correctly is when you put out a message that is understood the way you meant it. reputation was interesting because I’d never before had an album that wasn’t fully understood until it was seen live. When it first came out everyone thought it was just going to be angry; upon listening to the whole thing they realized it’s actually about love and friendship, and finding out what your priorities are.”"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"Then, during the Reputation Tour, she had an epiphany: that despite the caricature that she thought had been created of her, there were many people who saw what others had simply refused to. “I would look out into the audience and I’d see these amazing, thoughtful, caring, wonderful, empathetic people,” she says. “So often with our takedown culture, talking s— about a celebrity is basically the same as talking s— about the new iPhone. So when I go and I meet fans, I see that they actually see me as a flesh-and-blood human being. That — as contrived as it may sound — changed [me] completely, assigning humanity to my life.”"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"At tour’s end, she channeled that positive energy into the studio, recording the new album in just under three months. But the fast pace won’t mean a short LP. Swift confirmed that her seventh record (she hasn’t announced a title yet; the working nickname among fans is TS7) will include more songs than any of her previous releases. “I try not to go into making an album with any expectation,” she says. “I started to write so much that I knew immediately it would probably be bigger.”"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"The project will also feature a mix of old and new collaborators (on the candy-coated lead single “ME!” Swift brought in Panic! At the Disco frontman Brendon Urie and coproducer Joel Little, both of whom she had never worked with), but she is unsurprisingly coy about doling out much more information, as if doing so would break the carefully honed T-Swiftian feedback loop. “There’s a lot of a lot on this album,” she says. “I’m trying to convey an emotional spectrum. I definitely don’t wanna have too much of one thing…. You get some joyful songs and you get the bops, as they say.” There’s also, she adds, some “really, really, really, really sad songs,” but “not enough to where you need to worry about me.”"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"She gives us one more clue: The true distinction between TS7 and reputation is in the delivery. “This time around I feel more comfortable being brave enough to be vulnerable, because my fans are brave enough to be vulnerable with me. Once people delve into the album, it’ll become pretty clear that that’s more of the fingerprint of this — that it’s much more of a singer-songwriter, personal journey than the last one.”"
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"The past month has seen a deluge of Swift activity, from the release of the new single to dropping more hints in interviews about the record and its title, which is apparently hidden somewhere inside the “ME!” music video (current fan guesses include Kaleidoscope and Daisy). But if the Easter eggs from the pop star seem like a business-as-usual routine, she says this album does indeed mark a new era of her life, where she’s been better able to prioritize what’s important to her."
Taylor Swift Interviews by Genius Users,New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7 fan theories and her next era by Entertainment Weekly (Ft. Taylor Swift),"“Our priorities can get messed up existing in a society that puts a currency on curating the way people see your life,” she says. “Social media has given people a way to express their art. I use it to connect with fans. But on the downside you feel like there are 3 trillion new invisible hoops that you have to jump through, and you feel like you’ll never be able to jump through them all correctly. I — along with a lot of my friends and fans — am trying to figure out how to navigate living my life and not just curating what I want people to think living my life is. I’m not always able to maintain a balance, and I think that’s important for everyone to know about. We’re always learning, and that’s something that I also had to learn — that I’ve got to be brave enough to learn. Learning in public is so humiliating sometimes…. Do I feel more balanced in my life than I ever have before? Um, probably yeah. But is that permanent? No. And I think being okay with that has put me in a bit of a better position.” Strong words to live by, to quote, to re-share, to tweet back to her, and see if she’ll respond."
